# Gods, Demons, and other Immortals

## Gods

![](./images/Gods.png)

In the dawning of time, when the dreams and aspirations of mortals were still young and untempered, vast and potent energies stirred beneath the surface of the world. These High Points, as they came to be known, thrummed with the raw pulse of creation, shifting and growing in harmony with the ever-flowing tides of magic. Their forms twisted and reshaped themselves, ever adapting to the capricious currents of arcane force that surrounded them.

In time, some of these ancient structures—so saturated with power—began to stir with a nascent awareness. The fervent prayers and devotions of mortals, drawn to these immense wells of energy, breathed life into them. From the depths of mortal belief—shaped by dreams, fears, and desires—a consciousness arose: a sentience born of arcane essence. Wild, raw potential coalesced and became focused, shaping itself into twelve beings, each embodying a unique facet of humanity’s soul.

These entities, known as the Arcane Siblings, were not born of divine or celestial origin, but from the tangled knot of human will and the untamed magical forces that answered it. As eternal and vast as the forces that birthed them, they bore within themselves the flaws and frailties of their makers. Though wise beyond measure and powerful beyond mortal comprehension, they were still haunted by the same imperfections—the same longings and fears—that had given them form.

Dobhainn rose from the bones of the world. He is the embodiment of unyielding strength, enduring resilience, and the stoic might of stone. Where others bend or break, Dobhainn stands—immovable and eternal. In the realm of OnceWas, his presence is tied to the land itself, to the ancient mysteries buried deep beneath the surface and the treasures that slumber within the earth’s embrace.

He is said to dwell within the Great Mountain of the Elemental Plane of Earth, a place of endless stone and silent majesty. There, amid the crushing pressure and eternal stillness, Dobhainn keeps his vigil—watching over the secrets of the deep and listening to the slow, patient song of the world.

Among his most devoted are the Hammers of Dobhainn, a militant order forged in stone and battle. Crusaders and battle-hardened clerics alike fill their ranks, sworn to defend the dwarven realms and the hidden places beneath the mountains. With warhammers in hand and oaths etched into steel, they stand as bulwarks against the encroaching dark—whether it comes as marauding hordes, ancient dragons, or the infernal spawn of the deep. Their deeds echo through dwarven halls, sung in low voices around hearthfires and carved into the walls of stone temples.

Clerics of Dobhainn wear thick leather bracers set with heavy iron rings, symbols of the god’s enduring might and their solemn duty to guard the earth’s riches and truths. Their rites are slow and powerful—prayers murmured through stone corridors, invocations that ripple through rock, calling upon their god’s strength to guide their hands, fortify their spirits, and shield their kin.

### Gaoth

![](images/Gaoth.jpg)

|                                 |                                         |                   |

|**Holy Symbol:** Platinum Dragon | **Holy Day:** Stormbreaker's Day (April 5<sup>th</sup>) | **Dragon:** Platinum  |

Gaoth, the Stormlord, the Wind-Father, the Thunderbringer—his name is woven into legend, echoing through the ages like the roiling winds that herald a tempest. He is god of the boundless sky, of winds that sweep the earth, of thunder’s mighty voice and the storms that tear the heavens asunder. In the elder days, when the world was young and the air thrummed with untamed power, Gaoth stood as both protector of the light and scourge of darkness. His name is forever bound to the fall of Xalara, Queen of Dragons, and the end of the Dragon Wars.

It was on the hill where now stands the city of Realm’s End that Gaoth and Xalara clashed. The storm howled and the heavens trembled as wind and thunder met claw and flame. At last, with a cry that split the skies, Gaoth struck down the dread goddess of avarice. Her death cursed the land, her blood sinking deep into the soil, staining it with ancient malice.

The origin of the Stormlord is sung in the old songs of Dunmar, whose people speak of his arrival from the Stormspire Peaks, where the skies reign supreme and the winds never sleep. There, amidst jagged heights and endless gales, Gaoth first manifested—his form a living tempest, his eyes like the clear calm after the fiercest squall. From those sacred peaks he descended into the world of OnceWas, bringing with him the breath of the storm and the promise of change. Today, the Stormspire Peaks remain a place of pilgrimage for his faithful, who climb its paths to feel his presence in the howl of the wind.

The clergy of Gaoth wear robes traced with platinum, its bright gleam a symbol of resolve and unyielding strength. Their hearts are steadfast, their will unshaken, for their faith is forged in stories of divine valor. In Gaoth’s triumphs over darkness, they find guidance; in his thundering wrath, they find justice. When doubt howls and fear looms, the priests of Gaoth stand resolute—upholding the virtues of courage, righteousness, and perseverance.

In the province of Griffindale, the Church of Gaoth is led by Patriarch Wilam Menliam, a man of quiet strength and enduring faith. Wise and steady, Menliam shepherds his flock with the same patience and purpose found in the eye of the storm. Under his leadership, the faithful gather to honor their god, remember his ancient victories, and seek his guidance in their own trials of spirit and steel.

To those who follow Gaoth, his name is more than divine—it is a promise. A promise that every storm will pass. That the winds will carry them forward. That the thunder of justice will one day shake the world. Gaoth is not a distant god upon a lonely peak, but a living force—present in the rush of wind, the crack of storm, and every triumph of good over evil.

### Grund-Wyren

![](images/Grund-Wyren.jpg)

|                                 |                                         |                   |

|**Holy Symbol:** The Demon Face  | **Holy Day:** Abyssal Descent (March 3<sup>rd</sup>) | **Dragon:** Red  |

Grund-Wyrgen, the Dread Sovereign, embodies the deepest fears and darkest nightmares that haunt mortal minds. Born from the shadows that dwell within the deepest recesses of consciousness, she is revered as the mother of nightmares, monstrous aberrations, and the chilling terrors that lurk in the darkness.

Secluded from the pantheon of OnceWas and Elysium, Grund-Wyrgen harbors a profound disdain for the other gods, choosing instead to reign supreme in the Abyss, where darkness holds sway. Her realm is a bastion of chaos and malevolence, where the abyssal depths echo with the agonizing screams of mortals lost to their worst fears.

Clerics devoted to Grund-Wyrgen are enigmatic figures, shrouded in mystery and draped in robes of dark green, symbolizing the depths of terror. They wear white masks that conceal their identities, their faces forever hidden as they invoke their mistress’s terrifying influence. Scarification rituals mark their flesh, serving both as a testament to their devotion and as conduits for the dark powers they wield.

In the ominous city of Vornthol, nestled deep within the foreboding realm of Orckrag, Master Aakil holds the esteemed position of High Priest at the Temple of Grund-Wyrgen. Under his sinister guidance, the faithful pay homage to the Dread Sovereign through rites that evoke both fear and reverence. These rituals channel Grund-Wyrgen’s malevolent energies, spreading chaos and despair throughout the mortal realms.

Grund-Wyrgen’s dominion over nightmares and monsters makes her a queen of terror, her influence extending far beyond the mortal realm. Her holy symbol—the twisted visage of a demon’s face—strikes fear into the hearts of mortals who dare to utter her name. Her holy day, Abyssal Descent, observed on March 3rd, is a time of dread and foreboding, when her malevolent presence is felt most keenly across OnceWas.

In defiance of the light and order upheld by the other gods, Grund-Wyrgen stands resolute in her allegiance to chaos and darkness. Her followers, bound by shadow and steeped in the mysteries of terror, perpetuate her legacy through rituals that invoke nightmares and sustain the eternal darkness of the Abyss.

Clerics of Grund-Wyrgen suffer a –1 penalty to Charisma due to the unsettling aura of dread that surrounds them.

Then she is remote and weighed down by sadness at defeats and tragedies, even those that happened long, long ago.

Nergal is the patron deity of those who seek the greatest evil for their own enjoyment or gain. Most common folk do not worship or propitiate him, although they fear him greatly. It is believed that any form of appeasement will merely draw his attention, something that is at all costs to be avoided by the sensible. Nergal seems, in fact, to draw power from the very avoidance of his name. Some of the peasants of OnceWas do propitiate Nergal with minor rites, begging safe passage for the souls of the dead. Among the Barbarians of StoneHold, Nergal is considered to also be the god of winter.
Nergal's clerics are feared throughout the lands as cold, calculating murderers. They are secretive and often solitary. When not in disguise, they dress in all black. Those who would become priests of Nergal must undergo an arduous initiation that climaxes in being buried alive for a time.
Nergal's temples are hidden and usually subterranean except in the most evil lands, as befits the god of death and the underworld. Nergal's faithful believe they will be rewarded for acts of murder, for every living thing is an abomination in the eyes of the Reaper.
The Dark Abbot of the Cathedral of Nergal is Calliguri the Old of Dorakka in the Empire of Ix.
