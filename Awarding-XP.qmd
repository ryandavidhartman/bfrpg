# Awarding XP

Characters gain XP from **valuable treasures and boons** discovered during their adventures.  XP represents *worth*—not necessarily monetary value. Magic, secrets, and blessings can be as valuable as gold.

Each PC gains the **full XP value** of each treasure or boon recovered. When a character gains a level, their XP resets to **0** for the new level.

## Sources of XP

XP may also be granted for exceptional moments or discoveries, such as:

- **Gold and gems** of significant value  
- **Magic items** or **fabled relics**  
- **Oaths, secrets, or blessings** gained through play  
- **Meaningful trophies or tokens** tied to accomplishments  
- **Clever thinking** or problem-solving that changes an encounter’s course (+1 XP)
