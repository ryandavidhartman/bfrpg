# Starting Level

A character’s **level** measures their experience, skill, and renown.  New adventurers begin at either **0-level** or **1st level**, depending on the campaign’s tone and the DM’s guidance.  Each level represents growth through hard-won experience, earned not by time passed, but by treasure claimed, monsters defeated, and dangers survived.

## 0-Level Characters

Some campaigns begin with **0-level characters** ordinary peasants, laborers, or would-be heroes who have not yet proven themselves in the crucible of adventure.  These characters are fragile and untested, relying more on luck than on training or courage.

DMs seeking additional guidance should see [The Gauntlet](../gauntlet.qmd) section.

Because 0-level characters benefit from beginner’s luck, they may wield any gear until reaching 1st level.

**0-level characters creation**

0-level characters advance to **1st level** after surviving their first adventure. See [Advancement](12-Level-Advancement.qmd).

## 1st-Level Characters

Some campaigns begin with **1st-level characters**—fledgling heroes ready to face the perils of the dungeon.  They are sturdier and more capable than their 0-level counterparts, each possessing the first spark of true adventuring skill.
