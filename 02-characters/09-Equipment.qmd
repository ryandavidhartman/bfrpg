## Gear Slots
You can carry a number of items equal to your Strength stat or 10, whichever is higher. Unless noted, all gear besides typical clothing fills one gear slot.  Gear that is hard to transport might fill more than one slot.

## Starting Gear

**0-level** characters start with _1d4_ of the following items:

:::{#starting-gear-table}
| **d12** | **Gear**              | Gear Slots |

```{ojs}
import { generalTableSelect, highlightTableRow, readMatrixFromTable } from "../custom.js"

Inputs.button(
  html`<button style="color:black;background-color:lightgray;">Roll Gear (d12)</button>`,
  {
    value: "",
    reduce: () => {
      var matrix = readMatrixFromTable("#starting-gear-table");
      var n = matrix.length;

      // Roll d12
      var idx = generalTableSelect(
        [1, 12, 0],
        Array.from({ length: n }, function(_, i) { return [i + 1, i + 1]; })
      );

      highlightTableRow("#starting-gear-table", idx);
      // matrix row = [d12, Gear]
      var row = matrix[idx - 1];
      return "You rolled " + idx + ": " + row[1];
    }
  }
)
```




## Starting Gold

First level characters generally begin the game with _2d6_ x 5 gp (unless the DM decides otherwise).

```{ojs}
import { generalDice } from "../custom.js"

viewof goldRoll = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Roll Starting Gold</button>`, {value: 0, reduce: () => (5 * generalDice(2,6,0))})
```

**Starting Gold**: ${goldRoll}

## Coins

In **Old School D&D**, coinage follows the traditional fantasy standard: **1 gold piece (gp) = 10 silver pieces (sp) = 100 copper pieces (cp).**

To put this in perspective, imagine **1 cp** is roughly equal to **$1** in modern value, making **1 sp** about **$10** and **1 gp** about **$100**.  These values are only an abstraction to help gauge the relative worth of treasure and expenses in the game world.

## Special Weapons

- **Blowgun**. Firing this weapon from hiding doesn't reveal your position.

- **Bludgeon**. After making a successful strike to the head with this small club weapon, calculate damage (1d2), then roll another d20 and consult the results below. *If the opponent is wearing a helmet, roll with a DISV.*

| **d20 Roll** | **Result**       | **Effect**                                      |
|:------------:|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1–8          | Grazing Blow     | No effect.                                      |
| 9–11         | Dazed            | Opponent’s next round is at a DISV.             |
| 12–15        | Stunned          | Opponent’s next 1d6 rounds are at a DISV.       |
| 16–20        | Knocked Out      | Opponent is unconscious for the next 1d6 rounds.|


- **Bolas**. When you hit a legged creature the size of a horse or smaller, the target's speed is reduced to **Close** until it frees itself (DC 15 STR or DEX check).

- **Buckler**. A small round shield used in defense which is combined with a melee weapon in the opposite hand. Often bucklers were made with a sharp spike extending out from the front or side of the shield for offensive attacks. Bucklers are useful for deflecting blows, binding a fighter’s arms, or striking a blow. This weapon adds **+1 AC**.

- **Dart**. A small projectile weapon designed to be thrown by hand. It is usually coated with a toxicant applied to the sharp tip, enhancing its limited damage potential and making it more effective.

- **Heavy Crossbow**. The largest and strongest among the crossbows, giving this weapon the ability to deliver a powerful punch. However, the size and weight create a disadvantage, making it more cumbersome. The heavy crossbow requires **1 full round to reload** before it can be fired again.

- **Improvised Weapon**. Anything that can be picked up and used at a second’s notice. If you find yourself with a broken or lost weapon, a rock, bottle, bar stool, ceramic tankard, frying pan, tree branch, heavy tome, or whatever is at hand’s reach can serve. You may use any of these items as a melee or ranged weapon thrown up to a **Near** distance. The GM can decide whether Strength or Dexterity is the appropriate stat to use in each situation.

- **Katana**. An exotic sword originating from a distant and enigmatic land. They are only brought to this realm by a foreign keeper or venturous traveling merchant. Renowned for its legendary razor-sharp edge and superior balance, the katana is light enough to wield single-handed. However, its elongated hilt is designed to accommodate two hands, granting it the capacity to deliver truly lethal strikes that can decisively end any fight. Wielding this rare sword is a privilege; those lucky enough to own one hold its blade in the highest regard.

- **Pistol Crossbow**. Also referred to as the assassin’s crossbow, this is a lightweight and compact weapon that is easy to conceal. It is quick to reload and can be fired using just one hand. Despite its small size, it possesses considerable potency, especially when the bolts are laced with a venom or other toxic substances.

- **Repeater Crossbow**. This weapon revolutionized the process of spanning the bow, loading the bolt, and shooting into a single, fluid movement. This innovation significantly increased the firing speed compared to a standard crossbow. The design of the repeater crossbow was first developed by dwarven weapon smiths. It features a top-mounted magazine holding a reservoir of **10 bolts** which feeds the crossbow using the force of gravity. This crossbow fires **2 bolts per round**. Roll two separate d20 dice, one for each bolt when making an attack. It requires **1 full round to reload** the magazine.

- **Shuriken.** Can be thrown into the ground. Living creatures who steop on it take 1 damage and can only move at half speed for 10 rounds.

- **Staff Sling**. This weapon combines the wooden staff and sling into one. It can be used as a melee or ranged weapon as well. Unlike the standard sling, the staff sling can send much heavier objects down range, causing significantly more damage.

- **Stave**.  A surdier version of a staff, it has the sundering property

## Mounts

Mounts include beasts of burden and creatures with riders. All humanoids can ride common and uncommon mounts. Rare
mounts, like scrag, require special training to ride. (See [Monsters](../monsters.qmd#beasts-of-burden))

**Gear Slots**
Mounts have a number of gear slots equal to 5x their STR bonus. A *rider* and the rider's carried gear (such as a backpack and worn items) occupy 10 slots.

**Movement**
When riding a mount, you use its speed instead of your own. **Push**. While traveling, a rider can push a mount to move a number
of additional 6-mile hexes each day equal to its CON bonus. A pushed mount must pass a DC 12 CON check or be unable to travel the next day.  The DC increases by one step for each consecutive day of pushing

**Combat**
Most mounts bearing a rider can't attack in combat. However, a mount of LV 7+ may make one attack on its rider's turn.  Getting on or off a mount uses up the rider's movement.  A mount unaccustomed to fighting might **spook** during combat. The first time it or its rider is wounded, it must make a morale check. 

**Food and Water**
Warm-blooded mounts must consume rations equal to their base level each day (do not include bonus levels). Camels and cold-blooded mounts must only do this once per week. Mounts can go three days beyond their limit without water and three weeks beyond their limit without food. After that, they take 1d8 damage per day that can't be healed until given a full feeding of food or water.
