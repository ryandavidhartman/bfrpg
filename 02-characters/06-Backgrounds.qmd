## Backgrounds

Your character once toiled at ordinary work—plowing fields, hammering steel, or serving a master’s trade. Family and peers still do. Those years left you with calloused hands, a few hard-earned skills, and training in a simple weapon.

Your background knowledge and experience might yet prove useful on the road or in the dungeon. Work with the DM to decide when your past offers an advantage or a scrap of insight. Even humble trades can save a life when fortune runs thin.
