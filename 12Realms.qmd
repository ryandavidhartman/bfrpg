# The Twelve Realms

## The United Clans of Stone Hold

### Description

Stone Hold is the frozen realm of the northern barbarian clans, a fierce land inhabited by warrior people who do not farm but instead hunt and raid. They value strength and embrace their animal natureâ€”keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Civilization, education, and arcane magic are seen as weaknesses. The barbarians thrive in the snowy wilds of their homeland.

Most of the clans are composed of fighters, with some spellcasters among them, primarily druids and clerics of Enlil. The United Clans are in constant war with Glantri. Periodically, they undertake the "sailing the horn," a raiding journey down the Anduin, around the Isigir, and up the wild coast, attacking settlements along the way. This journey typically lasts about six months and is considered a rite of passage for warriors.

### People

The population of Stone Hold numbers less than 100,000, with 90% humans and 10% dwarves living in the Corrusk Mountains.

### Religion

The favored deity of Stone Hold is [Enlil](gods.qmd#enlil), the god of war. They also revere [Lovitar](gods.qmd#lovitar), the demigoddess of love and pain.

### Government

Stone Hold is governed by a council of 9 Jarls who convene every three years at the Maul of the Gods. The current Jarls are Ragnar, Ivar, Sigurd, Erik, Fergus, Torstein, Helga, Gorm, and Magnus.
