## Empire of Iuz

### Description

To the North West is the terrible Empire of Iuz. Dedicated to self-serving evil and pursuit of power, Iuz’s armies occupy even his own land as if it were a hostile country needing to be conquered. Refugees speak of a road of skulls leading to the capital city, and watchtowers along the road with beacons fed on the fuel of human fat and flesh.

Iuz does not hesitate to prey on the weak and has made several attempts to conquer surrounding realms. His empire currently encompasses the Land of Iuz, the Horned Lands, the Bandit Lands, and the Barren Lands. Few beings have a greater capacity for cruelty than the demigod Iuz. Iuz harbors an undisguised desire to dominate all of the OnceWas like the overking he once served.

Iuz is the son of the witch Iggwilv. Zagyg and the Circle of Eight banished and imprisoned Iuz 200 years ago. Though Iuz is physically absent, he still holds all power.

Of late, his influence has been inconsistent. Iuz’s servants have more control over some regions of the empire than others. Iuz’s clerics inflict cruelty and torture upon all who oppose them. Iuz tolerates no less than fanaticism and complete obedience. His clerics constantly try to outdo each other in their acts of cruelty and evil. They show their superiority over all other beings by hunting for trophies; rare finds such as unicorns or paladins are truly prized.

The clerics create spells and magic items of terrible power and evil nature and travel the world to commit acts of evil and search out Iuz’s enemies. Iuz is served directly by the Boneheart – two tiers (Greater and Lesser) of six advisers each (clerics and wizards), and by the Boneshadow, six spies and evildoers who roam the world. Iuz builds grand temples to himself in his nation-state, but his churches elsewhere are small and secret. He maintains important sites for mass rituals, sacrifices, and other ill deeds in forbidding wilderness terrain far from the eyes of good.

With Iuz’s disappearance, some of his more opportunistic followers and a few of his fiends broke away to form the Horned Society.

“The weak must be exploited, tortured, and stripped of hope. The strong must be constantly wary of betrayal by their underlings. Pain is power, and inflicting pain demonstrates power best. Crush those beneath you. Iuz must be obeyed, and those who defy him will know absolute pain.”

### People

The population numbers about 150,000, of which 55% are human. Of the remaining people, 30% are orc or half-orc, 10% are hobgoblin, and the remaining 5% are demonic. Another estimated 10,000 consist of the undead. Common is the predominant language, but Orcish and Demonic are also spoken.

### Religion

For a long time, the only deity worshipped was [Iuz](gods.qmd#iuz) himself. Note: The priests of Iuz were able to cast spells again about 10 years after Iuz’s banishment. Recently, cults of [Grund-Wyrgen](gods.qmd#grund-wyren) and [Nergal](gods.qmd#nergal) have quietly emerged.

### Government

The Empire of Iuz is technically an imperial theocratic dictatorship with demigod Iuz recognized as the supreme ruler. Iuz's priesthood and War Lords manage the affairs of the empire in his name.

- The mad Baron Numenor “rules” Greenreach.
- Baron Dorag the Boneshadow is regent in Fleichshriver.
- Lord Baltab the Immortal Orc governs Barad Perras in Narragor.

The Bandit Lands are loosely allied petty dictatorships, currently “administered” by occupying forces of Iuz. They are usually warlords and mages supposedly in service to Iuz.

The Horned Lands are an area of the Horns of the Dragon made up of Hobgoblins, Goblins, Bugbears, and Ogres. It is ruled by Lord Azarr Kul, Hobgoblin cleric of the cult of Tiamat.

### Heraldry

The coat of arms features a grinning skull on a black field.

## Glantri

### Description

Glantri is a country ruled by a council of independent princes, each a powerful magic-user. It is a place of wonder, beauty, and danger.

Once and always, the spirit of Glantri is linked with its magic. More than any other force, spellcraft has given every facet of this land a distinctly Glantrian hue. Powerful spells have left their mark on the realm’s geography. The pursuit of power through magic has dictated the direction of local history - just as it has molded the shape of Glantri today.

The capital city has a canal system and is home to the Glantri City School of Magic.

### People

The population numbers about 300,000, of which 70% are human. Of the remaining people, 15% are elves or half-elves, 5% are halflings, 5% are gnomes, and the remaining 5% are other races. Additionally, it is estimated that there are over 20,000 lycanthropes living in Glantri.

## Hammerfast

*Six have sat on the carven throne and ruled Hammerfast's pillared halls of stone where hammer on the anvil rings and ale horns raised to dwarven kings!*

### Description

South of Dunador, below the Lagithil river, lies Hammerfast, the Dwarvish Stronghold. Hammerfast is also the name of the massive mountains that contain the city-state of the dwarves.

Krimhold Battlehammer, the Dwarven King, has a great stronghold built on the highest summit. Its defenses have never been breached. Within the Dwarven King’s hold is the Great Dwarven Hall, a giant room with massive pillars where the dwarven king holds his audience. A giant stalactite lies in the center of the room and reaches nearly to the ceiling, hundreds of feet above. The stalactite has been hollowed out and used as Krimhold Battlehammer’s throne.

Beneath the Dwarven King’s hold are iron mines and giant caverns that dig deep into the mountain. The ore is transported to the port cities of Hel Gurihm and Nonlodar. The dwarves do not sail, so iron merchants from all of the surrounding Kingdoms travel to these ports.

### People

The population numbers about 50,000, of which 98% are Dwarves. The remaining 2% are Gnomes.

Dwarven (Underspeak) is the predominant language. Common is also spoken.

## Imladris

### Description

Imladris is a breathtakingly beautiful high elven city deep in the heart of the dense Luisian Forest. Lady Galadriel is the Elven Queen of Imladris, and she is the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remain in OnceWas. Hers is an enchanted, enriched land—a great magic forest into which evil cannot enter without difficulty. It is filled with thundering waterfalls, secluded valleys, colorful alpine meadows, and majestic mountains. Residents are almost exclusively elves, with high elves making up nearly 90% of the population, wood elves 5%, and moon elves 5%.

The Elvish Kingdom is protected by thick natural growth, nurtured to create an impenetrable hedge of thickets and brambles stretching out for almost a mile in every direction from the city. It contains an intricate network of secret passages and paths, both within the thicket below and in the branches above, combined with creepers, vines, and lianas that allow the city's protectors, mostly bladesingers and deft archers, to patrol the city's perimeter. If confronted by one of these protectors, it is likely that as many as 25 others are hidden and ready to aid their associate.

The elves create great works of art, music, and magic, but tend to keep their works within their own community, passing them between each other as gifts. There is no shame in "regifting"; in fact, quite the opposite. Some treasures have accrued a "pedigree" of sorts based on who has given the item to whom in the past—a practice that usually increases its value rather than diminishing it.

The Luisian Forest provides everything they need to survive, so they trade with others only very rarely, and only with other elves. As a result, most trade with Imladris flows through Ellesméra.

Given the longevity of elves, the high elves have guided the growth of the great trees over the eons. As you pass through the woods to the great river Harp, you see across the water immense trees actually bent into graceful arches, crisscrossed by wooden bridges, with high gleaming windows in the trunks illuminating the rooms within.

An immense temple at the center is formed of the trunks of three massive trees twisted together into a great braid, with the branches arching out over the nearest buildings like buttresses. Cypress or mangrove-like trees stretch out over the water, making a living complex of docks.

The temple is dedicated to Ki. Within the temple, there are shrines to other deities and spirits that Ki considers to be allies. The city leaders are both well-practiced in the art of magic as well as high priests.

The shining city is filled with light. Beautiful Elven music fills the air. The white stone buildings, rails, and structures are laced with elegant twisting branches and leaves. Abundant parks and gardens fill the city, reflecting the Elves' appreciation of the natural world and its beauty.

### People

The population of Imladris numbers about 4,000, of which almost 90% are High Elves, with wood elves (5%) and moon elves (5%) making up the difference.

Elven (Sylvan) is the predominant language. Common is spoken as well.

### Religion

The favored deity is [Ki](gods.qmd#ki), goddess of life and nature.

### Government

Lady Galadriel is the Elven Queen of Imladris.

### Heraldry

The coat of arms features a white tree on a green field.

![](images/imladris.jpg)

### Climate

### Cities

- Imladris, the capital city of the Elvish Kingdom
- Ellesméra, an Elven and Human village and a place where many half-elves live

## Isigir

### Description

Far to the southeast is the seafaring nation of Isigir. After the downfall of the Great Kingdom, the followers of Isig further descended into evil, taking to pillaging and piracy along the coasts of the North and West. A massive navy was built up, and Isigir remains the most powerful fleet in the twelve realms. Today, Isigir is an important trading nation but is also known to encourage piracy. It frequently hinders trade between Dunador, Keoland, and Nyrond. Isigir is the hated enemy of Dunador and a welcome refuge for its enemies.

### People

The population numbers about 300,000, of which 83% are human. Of the remaining people, 2% are wild elves, 3% are halflings, 11% are dwarves (living in the Iron Hills), and the remaining 1% are other races. Common is the predominant language.

### Religion

The favored deity is [Enki](gods.qmd#enki), god of water, the oceans, and rivers. The demi-goddess [Uinen](gods.qmd#uinen), demi-goddess of merchants, is also worshipped.

### Government

Isigir is currently ruled by King Castimir the Usurper in Umbar. Castimir is the first King not of Isig’s lineage. Beneath him are nine Sea Lords, the Council of Captains, each in command of one of the nine other cities on the coast of Isigir. Isigir has a powerful navy that frequently hinders trade between Dunador, Keoland, and Nyrond.

- Castimir the Usurper was not of the Isig bloodline nor a direct heir to the throne of Isigir. He was a noble of the realm and became the Captain of Ships.
- Even before Eldacar's ascension, rebellion brewed in Isigir, especially in the southern part where piracy flourished.
- King Eldacar maintained a difficult and unpopular truce with Dunador. Years of religious and political differences added additional strain. The Sea Lords saw Dunador as a competitor in trade and expansion in the 'New World' of the OnceWas.
- With the support of the nine Sea Lords, Castimir murdered King Eldacar of the House of Isig and claimed the throne in 635 A0M.
- Immediately, King Castimir attacked Dunador and the War of Belmont Bay began.

## Keoland

### Description

Keoland is a monarchy and one of the oldest political states. Great knights defend the kingdom from the Sunndi to the north, the Pomarj to the east, and the Lizard men to the south.

In the heartland, grains and other foodstuffs are harvested and processed to help feed the land. To the west, in the Good Hills, gems and ores flow into the cities of Cryllor and Seawell and then all across the Oncewas. To the north, on the Sheldomar, ships and barges carry Keoish products to all shores and bring back rare and exotic goods from across the continent. All of these industries and more help make Keoland the “Gem of the Oncewas”.

Keoland has been in a religious war with Sunndi for over 300 years. The war is known as The War of the Sun and the Moon.

## Nyrond

### Description

The Kingdom of Nyrond, birthed by the illustrious King Nyr, scion of the legendary Overking Accerak, once stood as a bastion of prosperity amid abundant natural riches. Today, however, Nyrond is a realm rent asunder, its lands scarred by the aftermath of bloody conflicts against the Empire of Iuz and the lawless Bandit Lands. The toll is grim: nearly 60,000 lives lost in battle, with twice that number fleeing in desperation, seeking refuge and livelihoods beyond its borders.

Amidst the fractured realm, morale falters among nobles, soldiers, and the commonfolk alike. Hunger grips the populace, pushing some regions to the brink of starvation, while the kingdom's once brimming coffers now echo hollowly. Taxation, necessary to fend off the looming threat of Iuz to the north, has become a crushing burden, stoking rebellious flames among peasants and urban dwellers alike. Streets once vibrant with commerce now teem with destitute souls, their neighborhoods overrun by beggars and urchins, symbols of a kingdom in decline.

In the heart of this turmoil lies Nyr’s Gate, where authorities pluck bodies from the ocean, grim testimony to the treacherous currents that run beneath the surface of the kingdom. Refugees huddle in impoverished districts, while trade, once the lifeblood of Nyrond, withers under the weight of uncertainty and strife.

Internally, the vital silver mines of the Flinty Hills stand as a beacon of hope, their bounty, alongside aid from allies such as Keoland, serving as the sole bulwark against Nyrond's collapse. Yet even here, tensions simmer; the dwarves of Dwarvengarde, nestled deep beneath the Dunatis Mountains, tread cautiously. Led by the wise DwarfLord Kelfex Grommet, these stalwart miners maintain a wary vigilance against potential foes, their autonomy fiercely guarded amidst whispers of political intrigue and distant conflicts.

Beyond the mountains, within the Plains of the Old Dominion, ancient nomadic tribes of wild elves ride their majestic giant owls, remnants of a time before the Overking's conquest reshaped the land. Distrust lingers between these elusive tribes and the dwarven enclaves, a fragile balance maintained through cautious diplomacy.

In the face of adversity, Nyrond's coat of arms—a resplendent blue Pegasus soaring against a backdrop of blazing orange—remains a symbol of resilience, a reminder of past glories and the indomitable spirit that yet flickers in the kingdom's depths. Amidst its temperate climes and storied cities like Rel Mord and High Vale, Nyrond stands at a crossroads, where the echoes of history mingle with the uncertainty of its future—a realm where every dawn brings both promise and peril, and where the fate of thousands hangs in the balance.

### People

The population numbers about 200,000, of which 89% are human. Of the remaining people, 4% are wood elves from the Celadon Forest, 6% are dwarves (living in the Dunatis Mountains), and the remaining 1% are other races. Common is the predominant language.

The favored deity is [Brigit](gods.qmd#brigit), goddess of fire. The demi-god [Girru](gods.qmd#girru), demi-god of volcanoes and fire, is also worshipped.

## Pomarj

### Description

Once this area was a Keolandish penal colony. It was called the Poor March then and it was a hostile land filled with orcs and ogres. The orc, Turrosh Mak, led a revolt against the Keolandish governor and his men, and Turrosh Mak reclaimed the land, renaming it the Pomarj as it is known today.

The Pomarj is a large peninsula located to the south. It was well known to be overrun by humanoid tribes and considered by most to be a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

However, of all of the OnceWas, the Pomarj is the most open melting pot of races in the Realm. There are still some dwarven miners living in villages along with orcs, goblins, and humans. A thriving black market run by human pirates has been the backbone of the Pomarj economy. While most consider this to be a place of outlaws, there are many who recognize that this is the only place in the OnceWas where human and demi-humans live together successfully.

A tavern in High Port called the Temple is legendary. All are welcome there.

Turrosh Mak is able to pass if disguised as an ugly human. When addressing his orcish followers, he also disguises himself and wears orcish war regalia in order to look more like one of them. He is tall and strong-bodied, but is starting to go gray at his temples. He is an intelligent and ruthless warrior, a survivor who will use any dirty trick at his disposal to stay alive.

Turrosh Mak is a founding member of the Slave Lords and is still closely allied with their present incarnation. He has pledged himself to Grund-Wyren in return for power and is thus allied with that god’s cult.

Turrosh Mak was formerly known as Theg Narlot. In 569 CY he joined a secret brotherhood assembled by Stalman Klim named the Nine. Later it would be renamed the Slave Lords. In 574 CY, the Nine assassinated King Rodric of Suderham; as the group’s assassin, presumably Theg Narlot executed the man himself. Within a matter of hours, the Nine had taken over the city. For four years, the Slave Lords kidnapped and sold slaves all around the Sea of Gearnat. In 580 CY, a band of adventurers attempted to defeat the Slave Lords. The city of Suderham from which they ruled was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Flamenblut. Theg Narlot disappeared into the Pomarj, but reemerged in the early 580s as Turrosh Mak, who used a combination of judicious assassinations and brute military force to unite the humanoid tribes of the region and forge them into a kingdom.

In Readying of 584 CY, Despot Mak sent his troops to conquer the southern Wild Coast and the eastern Principality of Ulek.

Turrosh Mak, blood of Krugur Mak, great reaver and bane to civil kind, chief of the Fire Skulls tribe, is now his Most Ferocious Majesty who holds rule over all Pomarj tribes. He leads with a brute force and cruel intelligence unseen in centuries. Standing nearly 7 feet in height and of gigantic girth, Turrosh’s presence alone commands respect and fear from the most fierce of warriors amongst the Pomarj Tribes. Having slain his own brethren, and challenged and defeated his own father Krugur, he succeeded to the right. With his own specifically chosen warriors, he acquired control-first of the Fire Skulls, then one by one, convinced chieftains through bloody ordeals or savagely conquered the other tribes. His is a leadership and control style unheard of amongst orc and goblin-kind. His word became law, his name demanded obedience, his tribe is now a banner to follow.

Of late, Turrosh has taken elven captives and through means of torture and false promise, learned their elf tongue and glyphs. When finished with them, he discarded their lives to the wolf pits, much to the entertainment of his subjects.

He is known to have taken several mates, be they wanting kin or captured slave, and has spawned many offspring to ensure his blood populates his empire.

Tired of being suppressed, Turrosh has decided the time has come for a new rule for the lands within …and without!

## Stone Hold

### Description

Stone Hold is the frozen realm of the northern barbarian clans, a fierce land inhabited by warrior people who do not farm but instead hunt and raid. They value strength and embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Civilization, education, and arcane magic are seen as weaknesses. The barbarians thrive in the snowy wilds of their homeland.

Most of the clans are composed of fighters, with some spellcasters among them, primarily druids and clerics of Enlil. The United Clans are in constant war with Glantri. Periodically, they undertake the "sailing the horn," a raiding journey down the Anduin, around the Isigir, and up the wild coast, attacking settlements along the way. This journey typically lasts about six months and is considered a rite of passage for warriors.

### People

## Sunndi

### Description

Far to the south, encompassing the entirety of the great Desert of Desolation, lies the nation of Sunndi. It is a land of harsh winds and blazing sun. Sunndi is a hostile desert nation of nomadic peoples ruled by dangerous warlords.

Its boundaries are formed by the Abbor-Alz mountains, and to the south is the Bay of the Efreeti. On this coast is the city called Bozisha-Dar, or "Gift of the Goddess".

On the sandy ground atop the Brass Cliffs stands a fortress, built by Sunndi people long ago for a great lord. The way in is hidden and narrow, but inside is a room heaped high with treasure. It is here that the ancient dragon Longspine guards this hoard of gold. His scaly coils sprawl in the pile of precious things.

Sunndi has been in a religious war with Keoland for over 300 years. The war is known as The War of the Sun and the Moon.
