# Character Classes

The allowed classes are Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Magic-User, and Thief. To be a member of a class, the character must meet the Prime Requisite minimum and racial requirements specified for that class.

## Cleric

Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast [spells of divine nature](spells.qmd#cleric-spells) starting at 2^nd^ level, and they have the power to Turn the Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone (see the [Encounter](combat.qmd#turning-the-undead) section for details).

The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear any armor and have no weapon restrictions.

## Druids

Druids are nature priests, revering the gods of the natural world.  Often a Druid uses mistletoe as a holy symbol, but this can vary with specific nature deities.  Druids spend their time contemplating nature or in mundane forms of service such as ministering in rural areas.  However, there are those who are called to go abroad to serve the natural order in a more direct way by working actively to restore balance.

Druids advance at the same rate as Clerics, and they use the same combat and saving throw tables.  Druids can cast [spells of divine nature](spells.qmd#druid-spells)  starting at 2nd level, and they have the power of Animal Affinity (detailed at the end), working much like the Clerical ability to Turn Undead.  They can identify any natural animal or plant, and can identify clean water.

The Prime Requisite for Druid is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Druid.  Druids may not utilize metal armor of any type, and they are likewise limited to wooden shields.  Druids utilize any one-handed melee weapon, as well as staff, sling, and shortbow.

### Animal Affinity

Druids can calm or befriend animals. The Druid rolls a d20 and adds Wisdom Bonus. Cross-reference the Druid's level with the animal's hit dice on the Druids Animal Affinity Table. The number shown is the minimum needed to Calm that sort of animal. 
Tame, Domesticated, or Normal Beasts of Burden are treated as half their actual Hit Dice, reflecting their relatively easy manageability. 
Monstrous animals such as griffins, owlbears, pegasi, or other such “near-natural” creatures are treated as they are 1 HD more than listed to reflect their unique natures. 
If the table indicates “No” then it is not possible for the Druid to affect that type of animal. If the table says “C” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically calmed. If the result shown is a “B” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically befriended.
If the roll is a success, 2d6 HD of animals is affected. Surplus hit dice are lost, but at least one animal is always affected if the first roll is a success. 
If a mixed group of animals is to be affected, the druid rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first and if they are successfully Calmed or Befriended, the same result is checked against the next higher type of animal.
If a Druid succeeds at Calming or Befriending some of the animals, but not all are affected, they may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Calm or Befriend the Animals fails, that Druid may not attempt to use their Animal Affinity ability again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.
Calm animals will not interact with the Druid in any manner, unless approached by the Druid. The Druid can calmly get them to leave an area, or the Druid can try to befriend the animals. In this case, the GM should roll a reaction roll with any result below favorable meaning the animals flee. 
If the result on the table results in automatically befriending the animals, the GM should treat the animals as if a “Very Favorable” result was rolled on the Reaction Roll Table. A Befriended animal will follow the Druid, guarding and assisting within its capabilities so long as the Druid remains in the general vicinity of its normal lair or range. 
However, it will not fight to the death or sacrifice itself indiscriminately. When substantially wounded, an animal will flee the area immediately. The GM may check morale as necessary when the situation seems appropriate.

#### NEW MAGIC ITEMS

The items listed below are magic items made by and for Druids. Unless otherwise noted in the item description, these items may be used by any class.

**Ring of t****he Green**: This ring made of what appears to be a tight collection of tiny green vines. When worn, the vines will writhe and (painless) grow into the wearer's finger. It takes a full week for the ring to fully bond with the wearer. Once bonded, the ring provides two benefits. The first is that as long as the wearer is outdoors for a full hour of sunlight (or two full hours of overcast weather), the wearer doesn't need to eat or drink anything for the day. The second is that each hour of complete rest in the outdoors is the equivalent of four hours of sleep.

**Ring of the Dryad**: This ring is made of highly polished wood. When worn the user is able to manifest the effects of a **tree** **sanctuary** spell once per day. The duration is for up to an hour, though the wearer can exist at any time.

**Slippers of the Dryad**: When wearing these light slippers (or sandals; their appearance can vary), the wearer is under the continual effects of the **pass** **without** **trace** spell, and is able to pass through any naturally overgrown area unimpeded.

**Staff of the Woodlands**: This staff operates as a +2 staff and provides its user with the continual effects of **pass without trace** spell. These abilities require no charges and continue to work even if the staff is exhausted of all charges. In addition it has several other abilities that do cost charges. The following powers cost one charge per use: **charm animal**, **speak with animals**, and**hold animal**. The following powers cost two charges per use: **summon animals II**, **animate natural object**. This item may only be used by Druids.


**Sword of the Sylvan**: This slightly curved single-edged sword (counts as a longsword/scimitar) is a +1 magic weapon under normal circumstance, but when used outdoors in a temperate climate it becomes a +3 magic weapon.

**Torc of Protection**: This ornamental neck ring functions as a **ring of protection**, but its power is passively activated by the wearer. If the wearer is level 1 through 8, the protection is +1; if the wearer is level 9 through 14, the protection is +2; if the wearer is level 15 or above, the protection is +3. As the protection is drawn from the wearer, this may only be used by Druids.

**Vestment of the Druid**: This is a light covering that can be worn over other clothing or armor. It is typically green (though sometimes brown) in color with natural scenes embroidered across the front and back panels. The wearer may manifest the effects of the **animal** **shape** spell once a day. The duration is for up to one hour, though the wearer may end the effect early. This item may only be used by Druids.

#### Making Magic Items

Druids follow the rules for cleric for making spell scrolls; they cannot make non-spell (i.e. protection) scrolls.

Druids of 7^th^ level and higher make potions as a Cleric, and Druids of 9^th^ level and higher may make the magic items listed here (plus any others that the GM feels are appropriate) as a Cleric.

Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, barbarian warriors, and anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon drawn.

Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.

The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter. Members of this class may wear any armor and use any weapon.

Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane. They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater power, but rather through insight and understanding.

Magic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling behind.

The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things interfere with spellcasting.

A first level Magic-User begins play knowing [read magic](allSpells.qmd#read-magic) and one other spell of first level. These spells are written in a spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player to choose it, at his or her option. See the [Spells](spells.qmd#magic-user-spells) section for more details.

: Magic-User Saving Throws {#tbl-save-mage}

## Thief

Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth, disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they crave; or “borrowing” money from pockets, beltpouches, etc. right under the nose of the “mark” without the victim ever knowing.

Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the Magic-Users at higher levels.

![](images/thief.jpg)

The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.

Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities, though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.

**Open Locks** allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails, the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of experience before trying again.

**Remove Traps** is generally rolled twice: first to detect the trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as the player won't know for sure if the character is successful or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.

**Pick Pockets** allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse, etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the roll is failed, the Thief didn't get what he or she wanted; but further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GM's option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).

**Move Silently**, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM. The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.

**Climb Walls** permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100 feet. See [Falling Damage](combat.qmd#falling-damage).

**Hide** permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.

**Listen** is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a noise *could* have been heard. The GM should always make this roll for the player. Note that the Thief and his or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.

Finally, Thieves can perform a **Sneak Attack** any time they are behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is successful. A Thief usually can't make a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in any given combat.

The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case [subduing damage](combat.qmd#subduing-damage) is done). Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the "flat of the blade;" the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in this case is subduing damage.

## Combination Classes

To become a member of a combination class, a character must meet the requirements of both classes. Combination class characters use the best attack bonus and the best saving throw values of their original two classes, but must gain experience equal to the combined requirements of both base classes to advance in levels. Elves are the only characters eligible to be a member of one of these combination classes:

**Fighter/Magic-User:** These characters may both fight and cast magic spells; further, they are allowed to cast magic spells while wearing armor. These characters roll six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.

**Magic-User/Thief:** Members of this combination class may cast spells while wearing leather armor, and may use any weapon. These characters roll four-sided dice (d4) for hit points.
