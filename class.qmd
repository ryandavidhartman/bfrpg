Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast [spells of divine nature](spells.qmd#cleric-spells) starting at 2^nd^ level, and they have the power to Turn the Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone (see the [Encounter](combat.qmd#turning-the-undead) section for details).

The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear any armor and have no weapon restrictions.

: Cleric Saving Throws {#tbl-save-clerics}

## Druids

Druids are nature priests, revering the gods of the natural world.  Often a Druid uses mistletoe as a holy symbol, but this can vary with specific nature deities.  Druids spend their time contemplating nature or in mundane forms of service such as ministering in rural areas.  However, there are those who are called to go abroad to serve the natural order in a more direct way by working actively to restore balance.

Druids advance at the same rate as Clerics, and they use the same combat and saving throw tables.  Druids can cast spells of divine nature starting at 2nd level, and they have the power of Animal Affinity (detailed at the end), working much like the Clerical ability to Turn Undead.  They can identify any natural animal or plant, and can identify clean water.

The Prime Requisite for Druid is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Druid.  Druids may not utilize metal armor of any type, and they are likewise limited to wooden shields.  Druids utilize any one-handed melee weapon, as well as staff, sling, and shortbow.

### Description of New Spells

#### **Animal Friendship** 

Range: 30'

Druid 1 

Duration: permanent

Upon encountering a normal or giant-sized (but not magical) animal, the caster may begin casting this spell, which requires an hour to complete. During this period the animal will remain nearby, and will not attack the caster or his or her allies for the duration of the casting (so long as they do not attack or otherwise disturb it). At the end of the casting, if the animal rolls a successful save vs. Spells, the spell has failed. At this point the animal acts naturally, without bearing the caster any special ill-will.

If the animal fails its save, it becomes an *animal friend* and joins the caster for the rest of its natural life, assisting in any way it can. Both the caster and any other *a**nimal friends* are treated as treasured partners. There is no arcane mental connection, nor any particular control, but rather a strong fraternal bond which should go both ways. If the animal is treated poorly, or it's love not returned over a period of time, it can attempt another save vs. Spells at the GM's discretion.

A caster may only have, at most, twice his or her level in hit dice of *animal friends*. If this spell is cast on an animal that would put the total above that number, it has no effect.


#### **Animate Natural Objects**

Druid 6 

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell functions identically to the cleric spell **animate objects**, but it may only be cast on living trees, plants, or fungi, wooden objects, un-worked stone or earth, or naturally-occurring bodies of water or ice. At the GM's option other natural phenomena such as non-magical fires or weather effects might also be subject to this spell.

#### **Assume Animal Form**

Druid 3 

Range: Self

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into the form of any natural animal. The assumed animal form cannot have more hit dice than the caster's level. If slain, the caster reverts back to his or her original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. The caster may remain transformed up to one hour per level, or end the spell earlier if he or she so desires.

#### **Call Lightning** 

Range: 100' + 10'/level

Druid 3 

Duration: 1 round/level

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and at most once per round thereafter, the caster may call down a 5 ft wide, 30 ft long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell's range (measured from the caster's position at the time of casting). Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs. Spells reduces damage taken by half.

The caster needs not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first the caster may choose to call a bolt instead of taking some other normal action. The caster may call a total number of bolts equal to one-third of his or her caster level, rounded down.

If the caster is outdoors and in a stormy area -- a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental) -- each bolt deals 3d8 points of damage instead of 3d6.

This spell functions only where the open sky is accessible, generally meaning outdoors; bolts may be summoned through windows or skylights at the GM's discretion.

#### **Call Woodland Beings**

Druid 4 

Range: 120'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell summons woodland creatures. They appear where the caster designates and act immediately, on his or her turn (they cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them). They attack the caster opponents to the best of their ability. If the caster can communicate with the creatures, he or she can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to perform other actions.

The caster may conjure one type of creature from this list, at his or her option:

- 4 Centaurs,

- 16 Pixies,

- 2 Treants, or

- 4 Unicorns

This spell only works outdoors in a natural location; it will not function in any artificial structure, nor within the boundaries of any village, town, or city.

#### **Commune With Nature**

Druid 5 

Range: see text

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster becomes one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. After 10 minutes of concentration, the caster instantly gains knowledge of one fact per caster level among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, presence of settlement or structure, or even the general state of the natural setting.

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings -- caves, caverns, and the like -- the radius is limited to 100 ft per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

#### **Control Temperature, 10' Radius**

Druid 4

Range: 0'

Duration: 1 hour/level

The caster can change automatically the surrounding temperature (10 ft radius sphere) by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit per caster level. The change can be upward or downward (caster's choice).

#### **Control Winds** 

Range: 0 (see text)

Druid 5 

Duration: 10 minutes/level

The caster alters wind force around him or her (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high). The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration. The caster may create an "eye" of calm air up to 40 ft radius around him or her and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than his or her full limit.

The caster may choose wind patterns over the spell's area. He or she can choose a downdraft blows from the center outward, an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.

For every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level (as described in the Waterborne Travel section of the **Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules**).

#### **Detect Snares and Pits**

Druid 1 

Range: 60'

Duration: 10 turns

By means of this spell, the caster can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

This spell does detect certain natural hazards, for instance quicksand (detected as a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long the caster studies a particular area.

-   1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards.

-   2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside the caster's line of sight, then the caster discern its direction but not its exact location.

-   Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by the caster.

Each round, the caster can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 ft of stone, 1 in of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 ft of wood or dirt blocks it.

#### **Entangle** 

Range: 200'

Druid 1

Duration: 3 rounds/level

This spell causes existing grasses, trees, bushes, shrubs, or other plants to entwine around creatures in a 40 ft x 40 ft area. At the GM's discretion a caster underground may use roots of plants or trees if such are present. Most creatures within the area of effect move at ¼ normal speed; very large and/or very strong creatures (at least as big or strong as a giant or dragon) move at ½ normal speed. If the creature affected is running at the time the spell is cast, the creature must make a saving throw vs Spell (with Dexterity bonus applied, if any) or trip and become prone and trapped until the end of spell. Entangled creatures may not attack nor take most actions other than movement due to the interference of the enchanted plants. This spell is only effective in a settings where plants will grow, including wilderness areas, farmland, and earthen-walled tunnels.


#### **Faerie Fire** 

Range: 200' +10'/level

Druid 1 

Duration: 1 minute/level

A pale glow surrounds and outlines all objects including individuals within a 20 ft radius from a point chosen by the caster. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, and the spell effectively negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

#### **Flame Strike** 

Range: 60'

Druid 5

Duration: Instantaneous

A **f****lame** **s****trike** produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high). The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.


#### **Heat Metal** 

Range: 25'

Druid 2 

Duration: 7 rounds

This spell causes a single item made of ferrous (iron-based) metal to become hot for a brief period of time. The affected item is warm to the touch immediately, and then becomes progressively hotter each round as indicated on the table below. The damage roll indicated is applied to any creature holding or wearing the affected item; a brief touch does no damage.

| **Round** | **Temperature** | **Damage** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1st       | Warm            | None       |
| 2nd-3rd   | Hot             | 1d4 points |
| 4th-5th   | Searing         | 2d4 points |
| 6th       | Hot             | 1d4 points |
| 7th       | Warm            | None       |

Note that this spell can damage items harmed by heat, such as potions for example, and might boil water, wine, or oil stored in vessels within affected metal item, possibly causing an affected vessel to burst. Generally this will happen on the 4^th^ or 5^th^ round, when the effect is at its most powerful.

The reverse of this spell is **chill metal**. It inflicts damage as outlined in the table above, but the damage is caused by cold instead of heat. Note that this can freeze water, congeal oil, and so on. Frozen water might burst its vessel.

#### **Hold Animal** 

Range: 180'

Druid 3

Duration: 2d8 turns

This spell functions like **hold person,** except that it affects only animals; specifically, this means non-magical living creatures of animal intelligence, including giant-sized animals. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist this spell.

#### **Obscuring Mists** 

Range: 20' radius

Druid 2

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell causes a bank of misty vapor to arise around the caster, remaining stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 2d4 feet. A strong wind can disperse the spell in one-quarter the usual duration

#### **Part Water** 

Range: 60'

Druid 6

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell, when cast on a body of water, causes it to part. This exposes a path that can be traversed as if it where dry land. Note that this spell does not change the topography of the bottom of the body of water, so the terrain my still be difficult to cross. The caster is able to affect a body of water up to 5 ft./caster level. The caster may dismiss this spell at any time.


#### **Pass Tree** 

Range: Touch

Druid 6 

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows the caster and up to two others to teleport between any two living trees on the same plane. The caster chooses a general location or a specific tree. The caster must have personal knowledge of the specific tree or general area of the target destination.

#### **Pass Without Trace** 

Range: Touch

Druid 1 

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell permits up to one creature per caster level to move through any type of terrain, leaving neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects by non-magical means is thus rendered impossible.

#### **Plant Growth** 

Range: special

Druid 3 

Duration: permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines) within 400 ft. + 40 ft./caster level to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Movement rate is reduced to a maximum of 5 ft./round, or 10 ft for Large creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. An area up to 100 ft radius may thus be altered. Also, the caster may specify an area (a path, a clearing, etc.) within the given area of effect which is not so affected.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures, that is, any self-willed and/or animated plant.

#### **Produce Flame/Cold** 

Range: 0

Druid 2 

Duration: 1 min./level

Flames as bright as a torch appear in the caster's open hand. The flames don't harm the caster or his or her equipment. Alternatively, a bluish, cold aura may be produced, which also sheds light as bright as torch-light.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames or cold aura can be hurled or used to touch enemies. The caster can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire or cold damage respectively equal to 1d6, +1 points per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, the caster can hurl the flames or cold aura up to 50 ft as a thrown weapon. When doing so, the caster must make an attack roll (with no range penalty), and on a successful hit deals the same damage as the melee attack. As soon as the caster hurls the flames or cold aura, a new one appears in his or her hand. Each attack made reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends with that attack.

Neither variation of this spell functions underwater.

#### **Protection From Fire**

Druid 3 

Range: Touch

Duration: special

If the caster touches himself or herself, this spell grants temporary immunity to fire (normal and magic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of magical fire damage, it is discharged. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

If the spell is cast upon another creature than the caster, **protection from fire** grants temporary immunity against normal fire. The spell also offers a +4 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and if the save is successful, the creature suffers no damage (and only 25% if the save fails). This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

#### **Protection From Lightning**

Druid 4 

Range: Touch

Duration: special

This spell functions exactly like **protection from fire**, except that that it protects against any sort of electrical or lightning damage.

#### **Rock to Mud*** 

Range: 150'

Druid 5

Duration: permanent

This spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud; up to two 10 ft cubes per caster level may be so transformed. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 ft. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 ft and causing it to suffer a ‑2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and armor class. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 ft., suffering none of the other penalties given.

If **rock to mud** is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool to a depth of 5 ft. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since **rock to mud** cannot affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such a buildings' foundation. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially-toppled by this spell.

The mud remains until a successful **dispel magic** or **mud to rock** spell restores its substance (though not necessarily its form). Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

When using the reverse, **mud to rock**, the spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently. Any creature in the mud must save vs. Death Ray to escape before the area transforms into rock (assuming it has enough movement to do so).

#### **Slow Poison** 

Range: Touch

Druid 2 

Duration: 1 hour/level

The creature touched by the caster becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. **Slow poison** does not cure any damage that poison may have already done, with exception of the following circumstances.

If cast on a character who received lethal damage from poison the previous round, the spell will remove that round's poison damage only, and delay it for the duration of the spell. Prior poison damage will remain unaffected, but, as noted above, no further damage is accrued until the spell lapses, and will never accrue if the poison is neutralized while this spell is in effect. This will give the poisoned victim an opportunity to seek a cure to neutralize the poison before it is fatal.

#### **Summon Animals I**

Druid 4 

Range: 40'/level

Duration: One hour

This spell summons 1d8 ordinary animals (including giant ones) of no more than 4 HD each if they are within range. The caster must name the type of animal summoned, and can have up to three choices. If none of the three species are found within range, the spell fails. The animals will be friendly when summoned and aid the caster's current task, including combat, in whatever way they can (to the best of their understanding). The caster may dismiss any animals called by this spell at any time.

#### **Summon Animals II**

Druid 5 

Range: 60'/level

Duration: One day

This spell is a more powerful version of **Summon Animals I**. Up to 3d4 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 1d6 animals of 8 HD or less.

#### **Summon Animals III**

Druid 6 

Range: 80'/level

Duration: One day

This spell is a more powerful version of **Summon Animals** **I****I**. Up to 4d6 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 3d4 animals of 8 HD or less, or 1d4 animals of 12 HD or less.

#### **Tree Sanctuary** 

Range: Touch

Druid 4 

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell enables the caster to create an invisible door in the trunk of a tree that is visible only to dryads and Druids. The tree must be at least 10 ft tall and planted in the earth for this spell to work. Once the spell is complete, the caster may enter the tree, effectively disappearing from sight. A caster may only affect one tree with this spell at a time. Furthermore, this spell may only be cast on a tree occupied by a dryad if the dryad allows it.

The caster is completely aware of his or her surroundings while in the tree, being able to hear normally and see in a 360 degree radius, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the tree. A Druid or Cleric may meditate to prepare spells in the tree. Each turn the caster sleeps inside the tree counts as a full hour of sleep. If the tree is an oak, the caster heals 1d4 hit points per turn spent inside the tree.

The caster loses the senses of taste, smell, and touch, and may not speak or cast spells while inside the tree. The caster takes half of any damage the tree suffers, and if the tree is destroyed or cut down, the caster is forcefully expelled into the nearest available space.

#### **Warp Wood*** 

Range: 50'

Druid 2

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster causes non-magical wood in a 20 ft radius to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open or becomes stuck; a boat or ship springs a leak; warped weapons (like bows and arrows) are useless. The caster may warp wood object(s) up to 1 ft on all sides per caster level.

Alternatively, the caster can "un-warp" non-magical wood (effectively warping it back to normal), straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. The caster can combine multiple consecutive **warp wood** spells to warp (or un-warp) an object that is too large to warp with a single spell.

#### **Weather Summoning** 

Range: 10 miles

Druid 6 

Duration: 5 turns/level

The caster is able to summon nearby weather conditions. The caster must be aware of the weather condition to summon it. This spell does not grant control of the weather to the caster.



### New Combat rules

#### Animal Affinity

Tame, Domesticated, or Normal Beasts of Burden are treated as half their actual Hit Dice.

Monstrous Animals or other "Near-Natural" Animals are treated as 1 Hit Die higher.

Druids have the Animal Affinity ability, which is the ability to calm or befriend normal animals. The Druid attempts to communicate a benign intent, and through his or her connection to the natural world the animals affected may be either calmed or befriended. The player rolls 1d20 and tells the GM the result. Note that the player should always roll, even if the GM knows the character can't succeed (or can't fail), as telling the player whether or not to roll may reveal too much.

The GM looks up the Druid's level on the Druids Animal Affinity Table, below, and cross references it with the animal's hit dice. Tame or normally domesticated animals such as livestock, family pets, or normal beasts of burden are treated as half their actual HD, reflecting their relative easy manageability. Monstrous animals such as griffins, owlbears, pegasi, or other such "near-natural" creatures are treated as they are 1 HD more than listed to reflect their unique natures. If the table indicates "No" for that combination, it is not possible for the Druid to affect that type of animal. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on the 1d20 to Calm that sort of animal. If the table says "C" for that combination, that type of animal is automatically affected. If the result shown is a "B" for that combination, that type of animal is automatically befriended.

If the roll is a success, 2d6 HD of animals are affected. Surplus hit dice are lost, but at least one animal is always affected if the first roll is a success.

::: 

Tame, Domesticated, or Normal Beasts of Burden are treated as half their actual Hit Dice.
Monstrous Animals or other "Near-Natural" Animals are treated as 1 Hit Die higher.

If a mixed group of animals (say, a boar and a black bear) is to be affected, the player still rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the boar), and if they are successfully Calmed or Befriended, the same result is checked against the next higher type of animal. Likewise, the 2d6 HD are rolled only once. For example, if the group described above is to be affected by a 2^nd^ level Druid, he or she would first need to have rolled a 15 or higher to Calm the boar. If this is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 6, this would Calm the boar and leave a remainder of 4 HD of effect. Black bears are in fact 4 HD animals, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the black bear is Calmed as well. Obviously, were it a group of 2 boars and a black bear, the 2d6 roll would have to be a total of 8 or higher to affect them all.

If a Druid succeeds at Calming or Befriending the animals, but not all animals present are affected, he or she may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Calm or Befriend the Animals fails, that Druid

#### NEW MAGIC ITEMS

The items listed below are magic items made by and for Druids. Unless otherwise noted in the item description, these items may be used by any class.

**Ring of t****he Green**: This ring made of what appears to be a tight collection of tiny green vines. When worn, the vines will writhe and (painless) grow into the wearer's finger. It takes a full week for the ring to fully bond with the wearer. Once bonded, the ring provides two benefits. The first is that as long as the wearer is outdoors for a full hour of sunlight (or two full hours of overcast weather), the wearer doesn't need to eat or drink anything for the day. The second is that each hour of complete rest in the outdoors is the equivalent of four hours of sleep.

**Ring of the Dryad**: This ring is made of highly polished wood. When worn the user is able to manifest the effects of a **tree** **sanctuary** spell once per day. The duration is for up to an hour, though the wearer can exist at any time.

**Slippers of the Dryad**: When wearing these light slippers (or sandals; their appearance can vary), the wearer is under the continual effects of the **pass** **without** **trace** spell, and is able to pass through any naturally overgrown area unimpeded.

**Staff of the Woodlands**: This staff operates as a +2 staff and provides its user with the continual effects of **pass without trace** spell. These abilities require no charges and continue to work even if the staff is exhausted of all charges. In addition it has several other abilities that do cost charges. The following powers cost one charge per use: **charm animal**, **speak with animals**, and**hold animal**. The following powers cost two charges per use: **summon animals II**, **animate natural object**. This item may only be used by Druids.


**Sword of the Sylvan**: This slightly curved single-edged sword (counts as a longsword/scimitar) is a +1 magic weapon under normal circumstance, but when used outdoors in a temperate climate it becomes a +3 magic weapon.

**Torc of Protection**: This ornamental neck ring functions as a **ring of protection**, but its power is passively activated by the wearer. If the wearer is level 1 through 8, the protection is +1; if the wearer is level 9 through 14, the protection is +2; if the wearer is level 15 or above, the protection is +3. As the protection is drawn from the wearer, this may only be used by Druids.

**Vestment of the Druid**: This is a light covering that can be worn over other clothing or armor. It is typically green (though sometimes brown) in color with natural scenes embroidered across the front and back panels. The wearer may manifest the effects of the **animal** **shape** spell once a day. The duration is for up to one hour, though the wearer may end the effect early. This item may only be used by Druids.

#### Making Magic Items

Druids follow the rules for cleric for making spell scrolls; they cannot make non-spell (i.e. protection) scrolls.

Druids of 7^th^ level and higher make potions as a Cleric, and Druids of 9^th^ level and higher may make the magic items listed here (plus any others that the GM feels are appropriate) as a Cleric.

Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, barbarian warriors, and anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon drawn.

Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.

The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter. Members of this class may wear any armor and use any weapon.

Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane. They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater power, but rather through insight and understanding.

Magic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling behind.

The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things interfere with spellcasting.

A first level Magic-User begins play knowing [read magic](allSpells.qmd#read-magic) and one other spell of first level. These spells are written in a spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player to choose it, at his or her option. See the [Spells](spells.qmd#magic-user-spells) section for more details.

Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth, disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they crave; or “borrowing” money from pockets, beltpouches, etc. right under the nose of the “mark” without the victim ever knowing.

Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the Magic-Users at higher levels.

The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.

Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities, though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.

**Open Locks** allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails, the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of experience before trying again.

**Remove Traps** is generally rolled twice: first to detect the trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as the player won't know for sure if the character is successful or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.

**Pick Pockets** allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse, etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the roll is failed, the Thief didn't get what he or she wanted; but further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GM's option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).

**Move Silently**, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM. The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.

**Climb Walls** permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100 feet. See [Falling Damage](combat.qmd#falling-damage).

**Hide** permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.

**Listen** is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a noise *could* have been heard. The GM should always make this roll for the player. Note that the Thief and his or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.

Finally, Thieves can perform a **Sneak Attack** any time they are behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is successful. A Thief usually can't make a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in any given combat.

The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case [subduing damage](combat.qmd#subduing-damage) is done). Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the "flat of the blade;" the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in this case is subduing damage.

## Combination Classes

To become a member of a combination class, a character must meet the requirements of both classes. Combination class characters use the best attack bonus and the best saving throw values of their original two classes, but must gain experience equal to the combined requirements of both base classes to advance in levels. Elves are the only characters eligible to be a member of one of these combination classes:

**Fighter/Magic-User:** These characters may both fight and cast magic spells; further, they are allowed to cast magic spells while wearing armor. These characters roll six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.

**Magic-User/Thief:** Members of this combination class may cast spells while wearing leather armor, and may use any weapon. These characters roll four-sided dice (d4) for hit points.
