## How to Create a Player Character

To begin creating your player character, you'll need a piece of paper to record their statistics. You can use a preprinted character sheet if available, or simply use a piece of notebook paper. An example character is shown below. It's recommended to use a pencil for recording information, as any statistic may change during play.

[Roll 4d6](appendix_interactive.qmd#character-abilities) for each ability score. Reroll any 1s and discard the lowest die. Assign the results to each ability, described in the [Character Abilities](abilities.qmd#ability-scores) section, as desired.

Write down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next page.

Next, choose a [race](races.qmd#character-races) and [class](class.qmd#character-classes) for your character. Your character must meet the Prime Requisite minimum for a class, as described in the [Character Classes](class.qmd#tbl-prime-requisites) section, to be a member of that class. Additionally, note that there are minimum (and maximum) ability requirements for the various races, which must be met, as described in the [Character Races](races.qmd#tbl-racial-requirements) section.

Write down the special abilities of your race and class choices, as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask your Dungeon Master  what spell or spells your character knows; it's up to the Dungeon Master  to decide this, but they may allow you to choose one or more spells yourself.

Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP). Also, you may want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class.

First-level characters begin play with the maximum HP for your class plus your Constitution bonus or penalty. Note the result as your hit points on your character sheet.

Roll for your starting money. Generally, your character will start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Dungeon Master  before rolling.  [Here](appendix_interactive.qmd#starting-gold) is an interactive tool to roll your starting gold.

Now, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the [Equipment](equipment.qmd#equipment-explanations) section. Write your purchases on your character sheet and note how much money remains afterward. Ensure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class and race before making your purchases. [Here](appendix_interactive.qmd#buy-equipment) is an interactive tool to purchase equipment.

Since you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don't forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.

Look up your character's attack bonus (see @tbl-attacking-bonus in [Encounters](combatDetails.qmd)) and note it on your character sheet. Don't add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e., melee or missile weapon).

Also, look up your saving throws (from the tables near the end of the [Encounter](combatDetails.qmd#saving-throw-tables-by-class) or at the appropriate [class](class.qmd#character-classes)). Note them on your character sheet. Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if your character is a demi-human (see [Character Races](races.qmd)). Please note that the saving throw bonuses for demi-humans are presented as "plus" values, to be added to the die roll. For convenience, you may simply subtract them from the saving throw numbers on the character sheet instead.

Finally, if you haven't done so already, name your character. This often takes longer than all the other steps combined.
