---

## Name
Choose a worthy name for your adventurer.

## Ancestry
Your character’s cultural and ancestral heritage.  Choose your [race](races.qmd#character-races) and note any special abilities it grants.  Make sure you meet the racial minimum and maximum ability requirements listed in [Racial Requirements](races.qmd#tbl-racial-requirements).

## Class
Your character’s vocation or calling.  Choose a [class](class.qmd#character-classes) that fits your concept.  You must meet the **Prime Requisite** minimum for your chosen class ([Prime Requisites Table](class.qmd#tbl-prime-requisites)).  
Record your class features and talents.

## Level
You begin at **Level 1**, unless your DM instructs otherwise.  Level advancement depends on earned experience points (XP).  You can note the amount required for Level 2 on your sheet for reference.

## Experience (XP)
You start with **0 XP**.  You gain XP from treasure, quests, and successful adventuring.

## Alignment & Deity
Choose your alignment — **Lawful**, **Neutral**, or **Chaotic** — reflecting your place in the cosmic struggle between order and entropy.  If desired, record your deity or patron.

## Title
As you gain levels, your title evolves based on your class and alignment.  Titles signify prestige within your adventuring community.

## Background
Write a short note about your history and what kind of life you led before adventuring.   This can inform role-play and grant the DM context for situational rulings.

## Stats
Roll **3d6** for each ability score using the [interactive roller](appendix_interactive.qmd#character-abilities). Assign each result to an ability as you choose (see [Character Abilities](abilities.qmd#ability-scores)).  Record bonuses or penalties from the ability score table.

## Hit Points (HP)
First-level characters begin with the **maximum HP** for their class plus Constitution modifier.  Write this total on your sheet as your current and maximum HP.

## Staring Gold
Roll **3d6 × 10 gp** for your starting money using the [Starting Gold Roller](appendix_interactive.qmd#starting-gold). Ask your DM if any adjustments apply.

## Gear
Spend your starting gold on items from the [Equipment](equipment.qmd#equipment-explanations) section.  Write down your purchases and remaining gold.  Confirm that your class and race can use each weapon or armor type.  You can also use the [Buy Equipment Tool](appendix_interactive.qmd#buy-equipment).  You can carry up to **10 + Strength** items (whichever is higher).

## Armor Class (AC)
Determine your AC based on your armor, shield, and Dexterity modifier.  Record this on your sheet.

## Attacks
List your weapons and note your **attack bonus** (see [Attacking Bonus Table](combatDetails.qmd#tbl-attacking-bonus)).   Add Strength for melee or Dexterity for missile attacks as appropriate.

## Spells
If your class uses magic, ask your DM what spells you begin with.  Some DMs may allow you to choose.  Write your known spells in the spells section of your sheet.

## Final Details
Write your character’s name, alignment, ancestry, class, HP, AC, and equipment on your character sheet.  Keep a pencil handy—everything can change once you start adventuring.
