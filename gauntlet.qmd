# Gauntlets

Before 1^st^ level, there is only desperation.

Old School play begins not with balanced heroes, but with the raw chaos of chance and survival.  This process known variously as the **Funnel** (DCC) or **The Gauntlet** (Shadowdark) forges adventurers from the dust of nameless peasants.  Only the survivors earn the right to call themselves heroes.

### Overview

Each player begins by generating **multiple 0-level characters** ordinary folk armed with hope and whatever lies at hand.  These characters are thrown into a deadly introductory adventure meant to winnow the weak and temper the strong.  Those who live through the ordeal ascend to 1st level, gaining a class, equipment, and their first taste of glory.

### Step 1: Generate 0-Level Characters

Each player creates **4 random 0-level characters**.  See [character creation](./02-characters/02-Starting-Level.qmd)

Each peasant represents a potential future class.  There is **no fine-tuning or optimization** just chance, chaos, and fate.

---

### Step 2: Introduce the Rabble

Once all characters are generated, players briefly introduce their hapless peasants to the table:  farmhands, candle-makers, beggars, or scribes—all dreaming of fame, treasure, or simple survival.  This creates immediate attachment to otherwise fragile, throwaway characters.

---

### Step 3: Enter the Gauntlet

The 0-level adventure should be **extremely dangerous** a true trial by fire.  Deadly traps, swarming monsters, collapsing corridors, and reckless treasure await.

Each player chooses **one 0-level character to run at a time**.  When one dies (and many will), the player immediately replaces them with another from their pool, explaining how the new fool arrived:  reinforcements from town, a rescued prisoner, or a straggler from the last village caravan.

0-level characters who reach **0 HP** die instantly. No saving throws, no mercy.

---

### Step 4: The Survivors

By the end of the session, most characters will be dead or maimed.  Each player should have **one survivor** who clawed their way through the nightmare.  That survivor becomes their **1st-level character**, gaining a class, hit points, and any rewards earned during play. Their background and scars from the Gaunlet define them forever.

---

### Step 5: Total Loss

If a player loses **all 0-level characters**, allow them to roll **1d4 new peasants** to join the adventure as reinforcements.  
The Gaunlet is cruel but never hopeless; fate always leaves room for one more fool to try.

### How to Run It

A good Gauntlet should feel like a **dark folk tale come alive**:
- Brutal, yet fair.  
- Filled with strange treasure, meaningful choices, and black humor.  
- Deadly traps balanced by enticing rewards.  
- Enough risk that survival feels earned.

The goal is not balance, it’s **story through attrition**.  Players end up deeply attached to the unlikely survivors who rose from mud and madness.

---

### The Spirit of the Funnel

This process replaces character “builds” with **character stories**.  Players find themselves caring about the one who lived—not because of a stat block, but because of what they endured.

Those 0-level exploits will echo through the campaign forever, etched in scars and legend.
