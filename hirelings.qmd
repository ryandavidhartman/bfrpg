# Hirelings

*Shadowdark* intentionally omits detailed rules for retainers and hirelings to preserve its “dark and lonely” atmosphere—rather than the old TSR-era approach of adventuring with a dozen paid lackeys ready to trip every trap in the dungeon.  Even so, such helpers can still have a place in your game. They’re useful for rounding out small parties, guarding mounts and supplies, or carrying torches while the heroes delve into danger.

As always, use your judgment and do what best serves the tone and needs of your table.

### Retainers and Hirelings

**Retainers** are non-player characters (NPCs) with class levels and adventuring experience.  They are mercenaries and sellswords who will accompany the party on expeditions and fight alongside them when the cause and coin suit.  Retainers will not hire on with parties whose average level is lower than their own.

**Hirelings** are zero-level NPCs—ordinary townsfolk seeking a few coins rather than glory.  They follow once the way is clear, carry gear and torches, and defend themselves only if cornered. They are not adventurers and will avoid danger whenever possible.

**Specialists** are skilled NPCs who perform professional services rather than dungeon work. They do not adventure, disarm traps, or fight monsters, but instead handle specialized tasks such as construction, animal training, or ship operation.  A player character may hire as many specialists as they can afford.  Charisma does not limit this number.

## Rules for Retainers

### Maximum Number
A character may employ a total number of retainers and hirelings equal to **3 + Charisma modifier** (minimum 1).

### Cost
Retainers expect a share of any treasure found. The amount offered modifies Charisma checks for both hiring and loyalty.

    For example, if 4 PCs and one retainer (receiving a ½ share) find 450 gp, that’s 4.5 shares.<br/><br/>
    One share = 100 gp. Each player receives 100 gp; the retainer receives 50 gp.

**Table: Retainer Hiring and Loyalty Modifiers**
:::

### Hiring
Make a **DC 9 Charisma check** to hire a retainer.  On a modified or natural 1 or lower, the NPC bears ill will toward the party.  On a 20 or higher, all future loyalty checks for that retainer are rolled with advantage.

### Equipment
Retainers begin with weapons, armor, and class-appropriate tools (holy symbol, thieves’ tools, etc.).  Additional equipment must be provided at the player character’s expense.

### Experience
Retainers gain experience at **half the rate** of player characters.

### Loyalty
Make a **DC 6 Charisma check** whenever a retainer faces great danger or at the end of each adventure.  On failure, the retainer departs and cannot be rehired.

## Specialists

### Alchemist
*1,000 gp per month.*  
Alchemists may be hired to brew potions or assist magic-users with research.

An alchemist can craft a potion given materials and either a sample or written formula, in the same time and for the same cost as a magic-user.  They may also research new potions, though this takes twice the time and cost.  See [Magical Research](gm01.qmd#magical-research) for details.  When aiding in magic item creation, an alchemist adds **+15%** to the caster’s success chance.

---

### Animal Trainer
*250–750 gp per month.*  
Animal trainers can tame and instruct beasts for riding, guarding, or labor.  Basic trainers handle common animals; those skilled with monstrous or exotic creatures demand higher pay.  A single trainer can manage up to five animals at once. Training may take months—or even years—at the DM’s discretion.

---

### Armorer (or Weaponsmith)
*100–500 gp per month.*  
Armorers maintain weapons and armor for troops or adventuring bands.  Typically, one armorer is needed per 50 fighters.  
Costs include apprentices (1d4).  Master armorers or weaponsmiths able to craft enchanted arms may demand higher wages.

---

### Engineer
*750 gp per month.*  
Engineers oversee construction projects such as fortresses, ships, bridges, and siege engines. Large undertakings may require several engineers.

---

### Sage
*1,500 gp per month.*  
Sages are scholars of lost ages and obscure lore.  They may charge additional fees for rare materials or deep research.  Each sagae maintains a library or collection suited to their field of study.

---

### Ship’s Crew
*Varies.*  
A ship’s complement includes sailors, rowers, a navigator, and a captain.  Typical monthly wages are as follows:

| **Crew Type** | **Cost (per Month)** |
|:--------------|:--------------------:|
| Captain       | 300 gp |
| Navigator     | 200 gp |
| Sailor        | 10 gp  |
| Rower         | 3 gp   |

All crew are unarmored commoners, usually armed with clubs, daggers, or shortswords.  Player characters may serve as captain, though inexperienced leaders suffer a **−2 Loyatity** penalty among the crew.
