## Brief History of OnceWas

![](./images/OnceWas.jpg)

_There once was a great kingdom. In ages past, it was united and flourished under the wise rule of Lord Feall, whose influence stretched from the distant Endless Sea to the expansive eastern horizon. For nearly two radiant centuries, OnceWas thrived, adorned with awe-inspiring architectural marvels, bountiful harvests, and bustling trade that wove the realm together._

_But the sands of time brought change. Feall’s noble spirit darkened with corruption and malevolence. Perhaps he was manipulated by his advisor, Ixalor the Necromancer, or driven mad by arcane longevity. Retreating from the world, Feall allowed Ixalor to seize power, ushering in an era of turmoil and tyranny._

_Ixalor’s iron-fisted rule spread like a malignant blight, a parasitic shadow draining the life from the once-thriving realm. Provinces rebelled, their banners rising against the necromancer’s cruel grip. The noble houses led the charge, igniting the flames of the Great Rebellion that shattered OnceWas into fractured kingdoms._

_Amidst the chaos, Dunmar, Hearthland, Solara, Arcanum, and Corsairia emerged as independent realms in their own right. Undeterred by dissent, Ixalor forged a dark empire in the North, bolstered by legions of orcs and undead horrors._

_With each passing day, Ixalor’s malevolent sorcery grew stronger, fueled by unholy rituals that drained life and power from the land. Once a man of noble countenance, he twisted into a grotesque, wretched specter—a loathed scourge upon the realm. His reign of terror endured until a coalition of brave magic wielders, armed with an ancient talisman of formidable power, banished him to the desolate reaches of the Void Beyond the Shattered Gate._

_Centuries passed like rivers flowing to the sea, and memories of Lord Feall, the Great Kingdom, and the tyrant Ixalor faded into the veils of history. All that remain are strange ruins, lingering ghosts, and the echoes of heroes who once forged their destinies—while new legends await their time to be written._
