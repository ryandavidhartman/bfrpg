## Brief History of OnceWas

![](./images/OnceWas.jpg)

_There once was a Great Kingdom ruled by Acererak, known as the OverKing, who had conquered all the land from the Far Away Sea to the Eastern Ocean. During his reign, advancements in architecture, agriculture, and trade allowed the Great Kingdom to flourish for over a hundred years._

_As time passed, the OverKing became corrupt and evil. Perhaps he was manipulated by his advisor Iuz, or driven mad by arcane longevity. The OverKing became withdrawn from the world, and Iuz ruled as his regent._

_Iuz’s rule was chaotic and cruel, a parasite over the Great Kingdom. The human fiefs rose up against him. The houses of Dun, Isig, Nyr, Keo, and Glant rebelled against the necromancer, marking the beginning of the Great War._

_The Great Kingdom fell quickly. Iuz created an empire in the North. The House of Dun raised the banner of Dunador, while Glantry, Keoland, and Isigir rose as individual kingdoms._

_Iuz’s necromancy continued to grow in strength, using dark rituals to steal power and life force. Once beautiful, Iuz now appeared gnarled and old, considered the enemy of every sane and free person in OnceWas. His tyranny ended when an alliance of wizards used a powerful magic device to imprison him in the Far Realm._

_Hundreds of years have passed, and the people of OnceWas barely remember Acererak, the Great Kingdom, or Iuz. All that remain are strange ruins and old ghosts._

### The Age of Dragons

- Most history prior to the Age of Dragons has been lost. What followed was a time of giants and dragons. It was a time when elves were numerous and men lacked the knowledge and mastery of steel and magic. Gods existed eternally but without form until the worship of men made the gods manifest.

- These gods aided men, showing them how to forge and harness magic.

- Tiamat spreads terror across the land served by the first necromancer - Urikel Zarl. Urikel distinguished himself by slaying dozens of Metallic dragons over the years. He delighted in resurrecting them as undead servants to his Queen’s cause. Tiamat rewarded her loyal servant by transforming him into a lich, so that Urikel could serve her for eternity as the Ghostlord.

- The Age of Dragons ends with Marduk slaying Tiamat. He fatally wounded her on Lonely Hill and she died in the Veronian Mountains.
