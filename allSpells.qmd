<div class="spell" data-tag="Alarm" id="Alarm">
## Alarm

Magic-User 1

Range: 20' + 10'/level

Duration: 2 hours/level

Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time any creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the caster at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. The caster decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.

Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster (and only the caster) so long as the caster remains within 1 mile of the warded area. The caster will hear a single mental “ping” sufficient to awaken the caster from normal sleep, but which does not otherwise disturb concentration. A [Silence](allSpells.html#silence-15-radius) spell has no effect on a mental alarm.

Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 ft of the warded area can hear it clearly. Interposing doors or walls may reduce the distance by 10 ft or 20 ft. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a [Silence](allSpells.html#silence-15-radius) spell cannot hear the ringing.

Incorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Alter Self" id="Aleter-Self">
## Alter Self

Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 2 hours/level

When this spell is cast, the wizard can alter their appearance and form--including clothing and equipment--to appear taller or shorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster's body can undergo a limited physical alteration and their size can be changed up to 50%.

The caster's Hit Points, attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, or defenses. Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. The caster can change back into their own form at will; this ends the spell immediately. A caster who is slain automatically returns to their normal form.
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Analyze Magic" id="Analyze-Magic">
## Analyze Magic

Magic-User 2

Range: 5'

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell permits the caster to discover information about a magic item or a permanently enchanted area. For each turn spent studying the enchanted item or area, the caster may learn one feature of the enchantment. Features include spell effects, bonuses, and command words or activating conditions. The DM will choose the order in which the features are revealed, but command words or activating conditions should be last. Note that the number of charges remaining for a charged item is not revealed by this spell.

Each turn of study requires the caster to make a d20 roll, adding their Intelligence bonus and level. The total result must be 16 or higher to succeed; any failure ends the spell. A natural 1 is always a failure.

The item or area to be studied must be within 5' of the caster for the full duration of scrutiny, and the caster must maintain moderate concentration.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Animal Friendship" id="Animal-Friendship">
## Animal Friendship

Druid 1

Range: 30'

Duration: Permanent

Upon encountering a normal or giant-sized (but not magical) animal, the druid may begin casting this spell, which requires an hour to complete.  During this period the animal will remain nearby, and will not attack the caster or their allies for the duration of the casting (so long as they do not attack or otherwise disturb it).  At the end of the casting, if the animal rolls a successful save vs. Spells, the spell has failed.  At this point the animal acts naturally, without bearing the caster any special ill-will.

If the animal fails its save, it becomes an animal friend and joins the caster for the rest of its natural life, assisting in any way it can.  Both the caster and any other animal friends are treated as treasured partners.  There is no arcane mental connection, nor any particular control, but rather a strong fraternal bond, which should go both ways.  If the animal is treated poorly, or it's love not returned over a period of time, it could attempt another save vs. Spells at the DM's discretion.

A caster may only have, at most, twice their level in hit dice of animal friends.  If this spell is cast on an animal that would put the total above that number, it has no effect.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Animate Dead" id="Animate-Dead">
## Animate Dead
 
Cleric 4, Magic-User 5

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Animate Natural Objects" id="Animate-Natural-Objects">
## Animate Natural Objects

Druid 6

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell functions identically to the cleric spell [Animate Objects](allSpells.html#animate-objects), but it may only be cast on living trees, plants, or fungi, wooden objects, un-worked stone or earth, or naturally-occurring bodies of water or ice.  At the DM's option other natural phenomena such as non-magical fires or weather effects might also be subject to this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Animate Objects" id="Animate-Objects">
## Animate Objects

Cleric 6

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12^th^ level, 325 lbs. at 13^th^ level, and so on).

The DM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the DM's discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10', and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the DM).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Animate Tool" id="Animate-Tool">
## Animate Tool

Magic-User 0

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 turn/level

A single, small tool (such as a quill pen, spoon, sewing needle, or small hammer) is animated by this cantrip. It will perform a single, repetitive task (such as writing dictated words, stirring a pot of soup, sewing the hem of a dress, or nailing boards into a house) for as long as a turn.

The magic user must be able to perform the repeated action by hand himself. Weapons may not be animated by this cantrip, and objects animated may not be used as weapons.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Anti-Magic Shell" id="Anti-Magic-Shell">
## Anti-Magic Shell

Cleric 7, Druid 7, Magic-user 6

Range: 10' Radius

Duration: 1 turn/level

Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell.  Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.

</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Arcane Bolt" id="Arcane-Bolt">
## Arcane Bolt

Magic-user 0

Range: 30'

Duration: Instantaneous

This inherent magic is a bolt of raw arcane power. The Magic-User doesn't roll anything, but the target gets a save vs. magic to avoid all damage. The bolt has a range of 30 feet and does 1d4 damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures, which are only affected by magical weapons, but do not affect inanimate objects.

The **Feat Arcane Bolt, Greater** (Magic User only) improves **Arcane Bolt**. The Target gets a save vs. magic for half damage. The bolt has a range of 40 feet and does 1d6 damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures, which are only affected by magical weapons. The spell does not affect inanimate objects.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Assume Animal Form" id="Assume-Animal-Form">
## Assume Animal Form

Druid 3

Range: Self

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into the form of any natural animal.  The assumed animal form cannot have more hit dice than the caster's level.  If slain, the caster reverts back to their original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains their own mental abilities.  The caster may remain transformed up to one hour per level, or end the spell earlier if the caster so desires.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Astral Form" id="Astral-Form">
## Astral Projection

Cleric 7, Magic-user 7

Range: Self

Duration: Special

This spell frees the caster’s spirit (or soul) from their body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.

The participants’ spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants’ original bodies in suspended animation.

This spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or the caster's new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants’ spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.

Unlike [Gate](allSpells.html#gate), the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, astral projection cannot be cast while still in the new body. To go to a different plane, the caster must end the spell, bringing everyone back to their original bodies and cast a new spell from their original bodies.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Barkskin" id="Barkskin">
## Barkskin

Druid 2, Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level

When the **Barkskin** spell is cast upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 17, plus 1 AC for every two levels. Armor Class 18 at 4^th^ level, Armor Class 19 at 6^th^, Armor Class 20 at 8^th^ and so on.

This spell does not function in combination with normal armor or any magical protection. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature the caster touches.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Bigby's Forceful Hand" id="Bigbys-Forceful-Hand">
## Bigby's Forceful Hand

Magic-user 6

Range: 10 yards/level

Duration: 1 round/level

**Bigby's Forceful Hand** is a more powerful version of [Bigby's Interposing Hand](allSpells.html#bigbys-interposing-hand). It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. However, the forceful hand also pushes on the opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs more than 2,000 pounds.

A creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage. The forceful hand has an Armor Class of 18, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to release a trapped opponent, for example) or dismiss it on command.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Bigby's Grasping Hand" id="Bigbys-Grasping-Hand">
## Bigby's Grasping Hand

Magic-user 7

Range: 10 yards/level

Duration: 1 round/level

**Bigby's Grasping Hand** is a superior version of the 6^th^-level spell [Bigby's Forceful Hand](allSpells.html#bigbys-forceful-hand). It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that appears and grasps a creature designated by the caster, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to escape it. The grasping hand can hold motionless a creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds weight, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 1,000 and 4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds.

The hand itself inflicts no damage. The grasping hand has an Armor Class of 18, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster can order it to release a trapped opponent or can dismiss it on command.
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Bigby's Interposing Hand" id="Bigbys-Interposing-Hand">
## Bigby's Interposing Hand
 
Magic-User 4

Range: 10 yards/level

Duration: 1 round/level

The **Bigby's Interposing Hand** spell creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that appears between the spellcaster and their chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. Neither invisibility nor polymorph fools the hand once a creature has been chosen. The hand does not pursue an opponent.

It provides cover for the caster against the selected opponent, with all the attendant combat adjustments. It has as many hit points as the caster in full health and has an Armor Class of 15.

Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal movement. If the original opponent is slain, the caster can designate a new opponent for the hand. The caster can command the hand out of existence at any time.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Black Tentacles" id="Black-Tentacles">
## Black Tentacles
 
Black Magic-User 4

Range: 100' + 10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

A field of 10-foot-long rubbery tentacles will spring from the ground.  The area is up to 30 feet by 30 feet, and they will appear from whatever surface is present, including water.

The tentacles will attack any creature in the area with the intent to wrestle/grapple them. They attack with the caster’s attack bonus and are considered to have a Strength of 18.  There are more than enough tentacles to individually attack as many targets as can be present.  If the attack succeeds, the target is held immobile and takes 1d6 points of damage each round it is held.

Any creature that is not held by a tentacle may still only move through the affected area at half speed.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Blade Barrier" id="Blade-Barrier">
## Blade Barrier

Cleric 6

Range: 90'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20' long per caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5' per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft. high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to half.

If the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful save vs. Death Ray.

A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against attacks made through it.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Bless*" id="Bless">
## Bless*

Cleric 2

Range: 50' radius

Duration: 1 minute/level

This spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50' radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical [Fear](allSpells.html#remove-fear).

The reverse of **Bless** is called **Bane**. It fills the caster's enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected creature to suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls, morale checks, and saving throws against magical [Fear](allSpells.html#remove-fear).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Blight" id="Blight">
## Blight
 
Black Magic-User 5

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell withers a single plant of any size.  It causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to the touched plant creature.  The creature is allowed a save vs. Spells for half damage.  If the plant is not a creature, it immediately withers and dies with no saving throw.

Only the touched plant is affected; the spell has no effect on anything else in the area.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Blink" id="Blink">
## Blink
 
Magic-User 4

Range: Self

Duration: 1 round/level

By means of this spell, the wizard causes their material form to “blink” directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after the caster has blinked.

Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink--the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard's initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from their previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction.   If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.

During each round that the caster blinks, they can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.

If the spellcaster holds off their attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to their normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, the caster probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get their attack in before the caster blinks (the caster must announce their intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative).

In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that their initiative roll is lower than their blink roll (the two rolls are not added if the caster is trying to attack before the caster blinks). If so, the caster attacks according to their initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If their blink roll is lower than their initiative roll, however, the caster blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction the caster's facing (the caster must go through with their attack, even if the caster is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Boneskin" id="Boneskin">
## Boneskin

Black Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

 The caster manifests a chitinous bone-like armor, giving a +4 bonus to AC. The boney bulk that is added doesn’t affect other spell casting.
 </div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Burning Hands" id="Burning-Hands">
## Burning Hands

Magic-User 1

Range: Special

Duration: 1 round

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from their fingertips. Their hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: The wizard's thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets 5 feet long in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard.

Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. Flammable materials touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Call Lightning" id="Call-Lightning">
## Call Lightning

Druid 3

Range: 100' + 10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and at most once per round thereafter, the caster may call down a 5 ft wide, 30 ft long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage.  The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell’s range (measured from the caster's position at the time of casting).  Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs. Spells reduces damage taken by half.

The caster needs not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed.  However, each round after the first the caster may choose to call a bolt instead of taking some other normal action.  The caster may call a total number of bolts equal to one-third of their caster level, rounded down.

If the caster is outdoors and in a stormy area – a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental) – each bolt deals 3d8 points of damage instead of 3d6.

This spell functions only where the open sky is accessible, generally meaning outdoors; bolts may be summoned through windows or skylights at the DM's discretion.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Call Woodland Beings" id="Call-Woodland-Beings">
## Call Woodland Beings

Druid 4

Range: 120'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell summons woodland creatures.  They appear where the caster designates and act immediately, on their turn (they cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them).  They attack the caster opponents to the best of their ability.  If the caster can communicate with the creatures, the caster can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to perform other actions.

The caster may conjure one type of creature from this list, at their option:

- 4 Centaurs,

- 16 Pixies,

- 2 Treants, or

- 4 Unicorns

This spell only works outdoors in a natural location and will not function within the boundaries of any village, town, or city.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Charm Animal" id="Charm-Animal">
## Charm Animal

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: 60'

Duration: Level+1d4 rounds

This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the same fashion as [Charm Person](allSpells.html#charm-person), at a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the DM) are allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will resume normal activity immediately.

This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animals; if combined with [Speak With Animals](allSpells.html#speak-with-animals), this spell becomes significantly more useful.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Charm Monster" id="Charm-Monster">
## Charm Monster

Magic-User 4 

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

This spell functions like [Charm Person](allSpells.html#charm-person), except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice. Saving throws are made just as for [Charm Person](allSpells.html#charm-person).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Charm Person" id="Charm-Person">
## Charm Person

Magic-User 1

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the DM's discretion). The caster must speak the target's language to communicate any commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster's enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe” place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Chill" id="Chill">
## Chill

Black Magic-User 1

Range: 10'

Duration: 2 rounds

This spell does 1d4 points of damage to one creature within range.  Furthermore, the creature must save vs. Paralysis or suffer -1 to melee hit and damage rolls for 1d6 rounds.  A large heat source nearby gives a +2 to save.  The caster may use this spell on one target up to 2 rounds after casting.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Clairaudience" id="Clairaudience">
## Clairaudience
 
Range: 60'

Magic-User 3

Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Clairvoyance" id="Clairvoyance">
## Clairvoyance
 
Range: 60'

Magic-User 3

Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Clean*" id="Clean*">
## Clean*

Magic-User 0

Range: 30'

Duration: Instantaneous

A mage making use of this cantrip may clean, shine, dust, or polish a small object or surface of up to 1 square foot. Reversed, this becomes **Dirty**, which can make the same area dirty, tarnished, scuffed, or dusty.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Cloudkill" id="Cloudkill">
## Cloudkill
 
Magic-User 5

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 6 rounds/level

This spell creates a 20'x20'x20' cloud of poison gas which moves at a rate of 10' per round under the control of the caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Command" id="Command">
## Command

Cleric 1

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 round

The caster speaks a single-word command, which will be obeyed by a single creature within the given range. The command must be given in a language the recipient understands. The recipient will do its best to obey, as long as the command is a clear, imperative verb. "Suicide" isn't a verb. "Die" would cause the recipient to fake death for the duration of the spell (believing it was dead). Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, fly, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc.

Undead are not affected. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 or more and creatures with 6 or more hit dice may save vs. Spells to resist.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Command Undead" id="Command-Undead">
## Command Undead

Black Magic-User 2

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

This spell allows the caster to influence an undead creature.  If the undead creature is intelligent, this spell operates as charm person, except that the caster can influence 2 HD per caster level, instead of just a flat 4 HD.  It otherwise operates the same, including duration.

If the undead creature is unintelligent, the caster immediately gains complete control, the creature gets no saving throw, and the duration is permanent.  Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the total control limit from re-animation.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Commune" id="Commune">
## Commune

Cleric 5

Range: Self

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or completely. These details are left to the DM's discretion.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Commune With Nature" id="Commune-With-Nature">
## Commune Wtih Nature

Druid 5

Range: See text

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster becomes one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory.  After 10 minutes of concentration, the caster instantly gains knowledge of one fact per caster level among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, presence of settlement or structure, or even the general state of the natural setting.

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level.  In natural underground settings – caves, caverns, and the like – the radius is limited to 100 ft per caster level.  The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Confusion" id="Confusion">
## Confusion

Magic-User 4

Range: 360'

Duration: 2 rounds+1/level

This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius circle around the target point to become confused*,*making them unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the following table on each subject's Initiative number each round to see what the subject does.

| d20 | Behavior |
|-----|------------|
| 1--2 | Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible). |
| 3--4 | Act normally. |
| 5--10 | Do nothing but babble incoherently. |
| 11--14 | Flee away from caster at top possible speed. |
| 15--20 | Attack nearest creature. |

A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Conjure Elemental" id="Conjure-Elemental">
## Conjure Elemental
 
Druid, Magic-User 5

Range: 240'

Duration: Special

A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) or [Dispel Evil](allSpells.html#dispel-evil) will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Continual Light*" id="Continual-Light">
## Continual Light*

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 year/level

This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the [Light](allSpells.html#light) spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.

As with [Light](allSpells.html#light), this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature's attack rolls if the saving throw fails.

The reversed spell, **Continual Darkness**, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Control Undead" id="Control-Undead">
## Control Undead

Cleric 6, Black Magic-User 6

Range: 60'

Duration: 6 round/level

This spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time. Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used. If communication is not possible, they will still not attack. Intelligent undead creatures may save vs. Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled. Unintelligent undead do not get a saving throw and the control is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the caster’s total control limit [Re-animation](allSpells.html#re-animation).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Control Weather" id="Control-Weather">
## Control Weather

Cleric 7, Druid 7

Range: 2 miles

Duration: 4d12 hours

The caster can change the weather in the local area. Any kind of weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area may be invoked. It takes 10 minutes for the weather to change to the desired conditions. For the duration of the spell, the caster may again change the conditions, but any such change will take another 10 minutes for the new conditions to arrive.

The caster has control over the general conditions of the weather, such as the direction and force of the winds, whether lightning is occurring, whether there is a tornado, and other directives. But, there is no specific control, so lightning cannot be forced to hit a particular spot and the path of a tornado cannot be dictated.

The spell allows the caster to remove conditions as well as bring them. (For example, an existing tornado can be replaced with calm weather.) At the end of the spell, the current conditions will continue, the caster just won’t be able to control them anymore.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Corpse Feast" id="Corpse-Feast">
## Corpse Feast
 
Black Magic-User 4

Range: 5'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell heals the caster and nearby active undead beings by draining the last energies from any fresh corpses (no more than an hour old) within the spell range.  The corpse must have been a living sentient being (i.e. not animal, undead, construct, elemental, etc). 

Any corpse drained using this spell provides vigor to the caster and their active undead allies within range, healing 1d4 hit points per corpse, up to their maximum.  Slain or destroyed undead do not heal or rise anew.  Any corpses consumed by this spell cannot be raised or resurrected.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Corpse Servant" id="Corpse-Servant">
## Corpse Servant

Black Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to temporarily animate skeletons or zombies.  A number of hit dice equal to the caster's level may be animated for up to one hour per caster level.  These non-permanent undead do not count towards the [Re-animation](allSpells.html#re-animation) spell limitations, but they otherwise conform to the permanent undead created by that spell.  Only one instance of this spell may be active at a time for any particular caster.

Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased.  Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life.  An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.  The caster must touch the remains to be animated.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Create Food" id="Create-Food">
## Create Food

Cleric 5

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster's choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting [Purify Food and Water](allSpells.html#purify-food-and-water) on it.

This spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.

With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including [Light](allSpells.html#light) or [Continual Light](allSpells.html#continual-light)). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.

Reversed, this spell becomes **Cause Blindness**, which causes a living creature touched to become blind. A successful melee attack roll is required to touch the
victim, and no Saving Throw is allowed. Blinded creatures suffer the penalties described in [Deafness and Blindness](combatDetails.qmd#deafness-and-blindness).

## Cure Disease*

Cleric 3, Druid 3

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

Cure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

Note: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.

The reverse spell **Cause Disease** infects the target creature with a debilitating disease, causing it to suffer from symptoms such as fever, weakness, or nausea. The affected creature must make a saving throw to resist the disease's effects. On a failed save, the creature suffers ongoing damage and penalties to its abilities until the disease is cured. The exact effects of the disease and the duration of its affliction can vary depending on the caster's level and the discretion of the Dungeon Master .

This spell works exactly like [Cure Light Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds), save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, **Cause Serious Wounds**, also works exactly like [Cause Light Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds), except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.

Dancing lights can be made permanent with a [Permanency](allSpells.html#permanency) spell.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Dark Flame" id="Dark-Flame">
## Dark Flame

Black Magic-User 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The caster produces a magical “dark flame” upon an object that does not produce heat or use oxygen. However, the magical dark flames allow all within 30 feet radius to see via [Darkvision](senses.qmd#darkvision) within the spell area, much like a normal lit torchwould allow for normal vision. The darkvision does not extend beyond the spell radius, and neither does the effect extend to any who might leave the area of effect. The spell does not provide any stealth bonus within the effect, as all (including foes) receive the darkvision.     However, because there is no light produced it may augment stealthy movement in general against those outside the spell range.

This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a 30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Decay Flesh" id="Decay-Flesh">
## Decay Flesh

Black Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This is a version of the [Cause Light Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds) spell dealing 1d6+1 points of damage to the creature affected by it.  The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage.  A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level have passed.

Unlike the Clerical spell mentioned, this spell may not be reversed.  However, this spell does work upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed 1d6+1 hit points instead.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Delayed Blast Fireball" id="Delayed-Blase-Fireball">
## Delayed Blast Fireball

Magic-user 7

Range: 100' + 10'/level

Duration: Special

This spell creates a small glowing bead at any location chosen by the caster, up to the listed range. This bead will explode in an improved form of fireball at a time chosen by the caster; when it explodes, it will do 1d6+1 points of damage per caster level to all within a spherical volume with a 20' radius, just as with the standard fireball spell. The bead may explode immediately if the caster so desires, or may be delayed up to 10 rounds; the caster chooses the time when the spell is cast, and cannot subsequently be changed.

If a delay is chosen, the glowing bead lies at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead (with the same range as a dagger); if the bead is handled within 1 round of its scheduled detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates instantly, i.e. before it can be thrown.

Druid 5, Magic-User 5

Range: 0'

Duration: 1 turn/level

The caster alters wind force around them (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high).  The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength.  The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration.  The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to 40 ft radius around them and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than their full limit.

The caster may choose wind patterns over the spell’s area.  The caster can choose a downdraft blows from the center outward, an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.

For every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Detect Evil*" id="Detect-Evil*">
## Detect Evil*

Cleric 1, Magic-User 2

Range: 60'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.

The exact definition of evil is left for the DM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.

Reversed, this spell becomes **Detect Good**, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.

## Detect Magic

Cleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1

Duration: 2 turns

The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Detect Scrying" id="Detect-Scrying">
## Detect Scrying
 
Magic-User 4

Range: Self

Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/leve1

By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt to observe them by means of [Clairvoyance](allSpells.html#clairvoyance), [Clairaudience](allSpells.html#clairaudience), or [Magic Mirror](allSpells.html#magic-mirror). This also reveals the use of **Crystal Balls** or other magical scrying devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to “sweep” areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the wizard who cast this spell immediately knows the identity and general location of the scryer. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, “The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,” or, “You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.”

<div class="spell" data-tag="Detect Snares and Pits" id="Detect-Snares-and-Pits">
## Detect Snares and Pits

Druid 1

Range: 60'

Duration: 10 turns

By means of this spell, the caster can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials.  The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

This spell does detect certain natural hazards, for instance quicksand (detected as a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall).  However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions.  The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long the Druid studies a particular area.

* 1^st^ Round: Presence or absence of hazards.

* 2^nd^ Round: Number of hazards and the location of each.  If a hazard is outside the Druid's line of sight, then the caster discern its direction but not its exact location.

* Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by the caster.

Each round, the Druid can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area.  The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 ft of stone, 1 in of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 ft of wood or dirt blocks it.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Dig" id="Dig">
## Dig

Druid 5, Magic-User 4

Range: 30 yards

Duration: 1 rd/level

A **Dig** spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.

Any creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.

The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Dimension Door" id="Dimension-Door">

Range: 10'

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any single target creature within range, to any spot within 200' plus 20' per caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will be transported also, including another character or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.

This spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster's pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a 10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is unaffected. The ray can target only one creature per casting, if that target saves, the spell is wasted.

First, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll). The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs. Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell, even if the saving throw succeeds.

Third, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can't be dispelled by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) also can't be dispelled by **Dispel Evil**. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use also ends the spell.

The exact definition of evil is left for the DM to decide; however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should almost always qualify.

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3

Range: 120'

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the **Dispel Magic** caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10^th^ level caster dispelling magic created by a 14^th^ level caster has a 20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by [Bestow Curse](allSpells.html#remove-curse) (the reverse of **Remove Curse**) as well as by cursed items.

## Disruption*

Cleric 1

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The Disruption spell blesses one blunt melee weapon, be it a mace, hammer, staff, with divine power. When fighting undead creatures or beings of the netherworld (demons, devils, and the like) the weapon is enhanced by +1 to hit and damage. This is in addition to any existing powers for an enchanted weapon.

Any being subject to this bonus that is struck in combat must save versus Magic or be turned, exactly like the cleric ability (see Turning in the core rules), causing the affected monster to flee the area. The character wielding the blessed weapon may opt to not cause the disruption effect, but must declare their intention before their attack roll. The caster can have only one weapon blessed in this manner at a time.

The reverse of this spell **Corruption** works exactly the same against creatures of goodness from various heavenly realms. Only those worshiping vile powers would have access to the reversed version of this spell.

This magic and an offering (such as tea leaves) puts the caster in contact with the pattern of the universe. This pattern can be deciphered to interpret dreams, predict the future, Identify a Magic Item, or to find hidden things.            

The caster may ask a single question. The DM roles on the chart below and gives tan appropriate reply based on that role. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

This minor magical effect allows the caster to sense the presence of potable water using a forked stick (any will do, but some have favorites). While outdoors the dowsing rod will twist to point in the direction of such fresh water up to 1000 feet +100' per level of the caster. Water that is underground, in containers, or within structures can be located within 25 feet +5' per level. The effect lasts as long as the caster maintains concentration.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Drainblade" id="Drainblade">
## Drainblade
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell imbues an edged weapon with the ability to drain blood with each successful strike made against a living creature.  When a living creature is hit by a drainbladed weapon, the target suffers 1 additional point of damage.  If the wielder of the weapon is injured, the extra point of damage is transferred to them as healing energy.  In no way can this healing energy grant more hit points than the wielder's normal maximum.

Against nonliving creatures, such as undead, golems, living statues, etc, this spell has no effect.

Magic-user 7

Range: Infinite + special

Duration: Instantaneous

When this spell is cast, the magic-user teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to their hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving. The desired item is then transported instantly into the Magic-User's hand. The item must have been previously touched and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Earthquake" id="Earthquake">
## Earthquake

Cleric 7, Druid 7

Range: 400' + 40'/level

Duration: 1 round

When cast, this spell causes a powerful, but localized, earthquake that is 10 feet in diameter per caster level. The shock of the quake will knock down creatures, topple plants, collapse structures, open cracks in the earth, and more. The effect lasts for one round, during which creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area. The specific effect depends on the type of terrain where the spell is cast:

• Cave, cavern, tunnel: Causes the roof to collapse causing 8d6 damage to everyone in the affected area (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble. Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.

• Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.

• Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures in the area have a 1 in 4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.

• Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring [hardness](combat.html#attacking-a-vehicle). If this causes the structure to collapse, anyone trapped inside takes 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.

• River, lake, marsh: Fissures in the bottom drain the water away, resulting in a muddy quicksand-like surface to remain. All creatures in the affected area must save vs. Death Ray or be stuck. After the end of the spell, the surrounding water rushes back in, potentially drowning any creatures stuck in the mud.

Any creature pinned by rubble takes 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per minute until rescued or they fall unconscious. Once unconscious, they take 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until they are rescued or die.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Ethereal" id="Ethereal">
## Ethereal
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell causes the recipient to enter the ethereal plane. They become semi-transparent and immaterial.  While in this state, magical weapons or weapons with certain special properties are necessary to strike the recipient.  Any stealth checks such as Move Silently or Hide are made at +4, and the character may move through materials up to 1 inch thick per level of the caster.  Some materials may prevent passage such as lead, gold, or other materials with special properties. While able to move through materials and effectively weightless, the ethereal being does not gain any other special movement modes like flying or levitation; walking upon materials such as water is possible though.

The ethereal character may not make physical attacks but may cast spells that do not require physical contact.  While the spell is active, the individual may choose to revert back and forth between corporeal and incorporeal forms on their turn, remaining in the chosen state until their next turn. 

There is a 10% chance (DC 2) that each turn that a creature is ethereal that they will draw the attention of a wraith (1) or ghost (2) that will immediately attack.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Enervation" id="Enervation">
## Enervation

Black Magic-User 4

Range: 50'

Duration: Instantaneous

The caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any Dexterity bonus).  If the narrow ray of crackling black energy hits, the target suffers 1d4 negative levels and all of the effects described in [Energy Drain](healingAndInjuries.qmd#energy-drain). There is no saving throw, only the attack roll.

If the target survives, it will lose the negative levels (i.e. regain their levels) after a number of hours equal to the caster’s level.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 5d4 temporary hit points for one hour.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Enlarge" id="Enlarge">
## Enlarge*

Magic-User 1

Range: 5 yards/level

Duration: 5 rounds/level

This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the magic-user, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight will increase cubicly.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.

Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.

For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with their long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.

The reverse spell, **Reduce**, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.

For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15^th^-level magic-user (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Entagle" id="Entagle">
## Entagle

Druid 1

Range: 200'

Duration: 3 rounds/level

This spell causes existing grasses, trees, bushes, shrubs, or other plants to entwine around creatures in a 40 ft x 40 ft area. At the DM's discretion a caster underground may use roots of plants or trees if such are present. Most creatures within the area of effect move at ¼ normal speed; very large and/or very strong creatures (at least as big or strong as a giant or dragon) move at ½ normal speed.

If the creature affected is running at the time the spell is cast, the creature must make a saving throw vs Spell (with Dexterity bonus applied, if any) or trip and become prone and trapped until the end of spell.  Entangled creatures may not attack nor take most actions other than movement due to the interference of the enchanted plants. This spell is only effective in a settings where plants will grow, including wilderness areas, farmland, and earthen-walled tunnels.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Entangling Thorns" id="Entangling-Thorns">
## Entangling Thorns

Druid 3

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

The druid chooses one target creature (or object) within range, beneath which great thorny tendrils quickly grow up and around. If the subject fails its save vs. Spells, it is held immobile, suffering a -2 penalty to hit and a -4 penalty to its armor class. In addition, the thorny growths cause 1d4 points of damage to the target each round. An individual so entangled may only cast spells if a DC 15 is achieved, modified by their primary spell casting ability score bonus.

The process of breaking free takes the entire round, during which damage is still incurred. Additionally, the thorny growths can be directly attacked (against AC 11) with small bladed weapons such as daggers or hand axes. The vines have 22 hp and destroying them ends the spell. Immediately. Using other larger weapons or spells will damage the entangled creature as much as the thorns, splitting the damage between them equally.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="ESP" id="ESP">
## ESP
 
Magic-User 2

Range: 60'

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of one or more targets within range.  The caster must designate a direction, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear” the thoughts.  Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a different direction.  The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the duration has not expired.  The target creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way.

Rock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold will block the spell.  All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Ether Bold" id="Ether-Bolt">
## Ether Bolt
 
Magic-User 2

Range: 30' + 5'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell fires off a missile or beam-like effect that only strikes foes that are insubstantial, ethereal, phase-shifted, or otherwise not fully materially present. This primarily includes various types of undead, but may include other beings that have similar qualities such as shadows. Much like a magic missile, the bolt strikes unerringly if the target is in sight, causing 1d4 points of force-like impact damage per level of the caster, striking as if the target was a completely solid being.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Extension" id="Extension">
## Extension

Magic-User 4

Range: Special

Duration: Special

By use of an extension spell, the wizard doubles the duration of a previously cast 1^st^-, 2^nd^-, or 3^rd^-level spell. Naturally, the spell affects only spells that have durations.

This spell must be cast immediately after the spell to be extended, either by the original caster or another wizard. If a complete round or more elapses, the extension fails and is wasted.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Eyebite" id="Eyebit">
## Eyebite
 
Black Magic-User 6

Range: 60'

Duration: 1 round/3 levels

Each round the caster may target a single living creature for the duration of the spell.  The affected creature suffers effects depending on its total hit dice.  If the target has 10 HD or more, it is sickened.  If the target has 5 HD through 9 HD, it is panicked and sickened.  If the target has 4 HD or fewer, it is comatose, panicked, and sickened.  The effects are cumulative and concurrent.  Targeting each additional creature after the first requires an action, and only one may be targeted in a given round.

The target must save vs. Death Ray to avoid the worst effect of the spell.  If the target is affected by more than one effect, the remaining effects are still present.

If a creature is sickened, it suffers from a -2 modifier for attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.  This effect lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

If a creature is panicked, it will flee for 1d4 rounds.  After that, the victim will flee again for 1d4 rounds if it can still see the caster.  Even after the fleeing ends, the creature is still affected by the sickening as described above.

If a creature is comatose, it falls into a coma for 1 turn per caster level.  During this time, the victim cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect.  Even if the comma is dispelled, the creature is still subject to fleeing if the caster is visible, and is still sickened.  This is not a sleep effect.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Faerie Fire" id="Faerie-Fire">
## Faerie Fire

Druid 1, Magic-User 2

Range: 200’ +10'/level

Duration: 1 minute/level

A pale glow surrounds and outlines all objects including individuals within a 20 ft radius from a point chosen by the caster.  Outlined subjects shed light as candles.  Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, and the spell effectively negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. 

The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.  The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting.  The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Faerie Ring" id="Faerie-Ring">
## Faerie Ring

Druid 7

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 hour/level

When the caster creates a Faerie Ring, a small circle of distinct mushrooms or toadstools grow quickly. Those that walk into the circle (about 5 foot diameter) are transported into a region that borders the FeyWild (another plane of existence). This region can be utilized as a safe place to rest and recuperate (at double normal rate for purpose of healing and restoration of spells). From this border region, one may pass back into the familiar prime world or they might travel to the actual FeyWild.

The Feywild is the Plane of Faeries and it intersects with the OnceWas. The FeyWild is an echo of the real world but suffused with potent magic and unrestrained emotions. As an echo of OnceWas, its geography is similar although not entirely identical. The landscape is markedly more dramatic and beautiful with more trees and flowers.  The mountains stand straighter and sharper. The rivers flow clearer and faster, the flowers bloom brighter and more fragrantly, and the weather manifests in supernatural ways.

Time does not flow the same in the Feywild as it does in the OnceWas. While any visitor would experience time flowing as normal, it is often the case that more time was passing in the real world, sometimes on the order of weeks, months, or years longer than expected.

More concerning, leaving the Feywild can have dire consequences. Lost time could suddenly "catch up" to a mortal, sending them into fits of exhaustion or hunger, or even killing them instantly if many years had passed. Often, memories of time spent in the Feywild become hazy and dreamlike, if not vanishing altogether.

It is said to be the place from where the first elves originated.

Ki, goddess of life and nature and Queen of faeries, is known to spend time in the FeyWild when not in Elysium or in the OnceWas.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Familiar*" id="Familiar">
## Familiar

Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

With this spell, the caster binds a single animal into their service as a familiar. The spell requires 10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier. The creature must be present, and the caster must touch it to cast the spell.

Only normal (non-magical) creatures of 1-1 hit die may be made into familiars. Further, each spellcaster may have only one familiar at a time. If a familiar dies, the caster will not be able to successfully cast this spell again for 2d6 months (the period to be rolled by the DM and not revealed to the player). A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist, and if this roll succeeds, the animal chosen is not compatible with the caster and cannot become their familiar.

The familiar will behave as if permanently charmed by its master and will perform any task assigned to it to the best of its ability. The creature's morale is increased by 2 points (to a maximum of 11), and it receives improved intelligence equal to 3+1d4 points. Familiars also age at half the normal rate for their kind, so a cat familiar (for instance) might easily live forty years.

The familiar's hit points are added to the Magic User 's. If a familiar is slain, the Magic User loses double the familiar's hit points, permanently.

In combat, it shares initiative and acts at the end of the Magic User’s turn.

Within 200 feet, the Magic User can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears, returning to the Magic User’s senses at will. During this time, the Magic User is deaf and blind regarding their own senses.

Additionally, while the familiar is within 100 feet of the Magic User, they can communicate telepathically. This communication is in simple telepathic concepts, such as "3 angry people. One is short" or "path forks, 3 ways ahead, smells like food". Not enough detail for a map.

Druid 5, Magic-User 5

Range: 60'

Duration: Instantaneoous

A **Flame Strike** produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high).  The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Feather Fall" id="Feather-Fall">
## Feather Fall

Magic-User 1

Range: 10 yards/level

Duration: 1 round/level

When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 2 feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard.

The feather fall affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.

For example, a 2^nd^-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. Note that the spell can be effectively combined with [Gust of Wind](allSpells.html#gust-of-wind) and similar spells.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Feeblemind*" id="Feeblemind*">
## Feeblemind*

Range: 180'

Magic-User 5

Duration: Permanent

This spell allows the caster to inflict a terrible curse on a living creature, reducing both Intelligence and Charisma to just 1 point each. A saving throw vs. Spells is
allowed to resist this effect, but if the target creature is a spellcaster a penalty of -4 is applied to the saving throw.

Once feebleminded, the victim of this spell can no longer cast spells, speak or understand any language, or indeed communicate at all as their mind can no longer
understand even such simple things as pointing or beckoning. The victim still knows their friends and allies and will follow them and try to help or protect
them.

This effect can be removed with a [Heal](allSpells.html#heal) spell, or with the reversed form of this spell **Restoremind**.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Find Traps" id="Find-Traps">
## Find Traps

Cleric 2

Range: 30'

Duration: 3 turns

This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about its type or nature.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Find the Path" id="Find-the-Path">
## Find the Path

Cleric 6, Druid 6

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.

The locale can be outdoors or underground. **Find the path** works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.

## Finger of Death

Black Magic-user 7

Range: 25' + 5'/2 levels

Duration: Instantaneous

The **Finger of Death** spell snuffs out the victim's life force. If successful, the victim can be neither raised nor resurrected. In addition, in human subjects the spell initiates changes to the body such that after three days the caster can, by means of a special ceremony costing not less than 1,000 gp plus 500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a juju zombie under the control of the caster. The changes can be reversed before animation by a **Limited Wish** or similar spell cast directly upon the body, and a full **Wish** restores the subject to life.

The caster utters the **Finger of Death** spell incantation, points their index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death occurs. A creature successfully saving still receives 2d8+1 points of damage. If the subject dies of damage, no internal changes occur and the victim can then be revived normally.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Fireball" id="Fireball">
## Fireball
 
Magic-User 3

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20' radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

Wrapped in cold magical flames and gifted with a form of levitation-based flight, the flaming skull can fetch small items, convey messages, or other similar tasks for the Black Magic-User.  When not tasked with a specific duty, the fireskull familiar generally hovers near its master, providing light equal to torchlight.  A Black Magic-User may have only one instance of this spell active at a time.  Subsequent castings have no effect unless the first instance of the spell is dismissed or destroyed.

The fireskull familiar is not designed for combat, having hit points equal to 25% of the Black Magic-User's total hit points.  The skull has an Armor Class of 13 and only a single attack for 1d2 points of damage, attacking with the same basic chance to hit as the Black Magic-User.  The skull can be charged with spells that must be delivered by touch, with the spell effect being available to the skull on the following round.  While a fireskull familiar is within 5 feet, the caster's chance of being surprised is reduced by 1.

Of interesting note, although each skull does not remember any details of its former life, it does retain many personality traits, making each skull distinct from the next.  Practitioners of this spell often have favorite skulls that they use regularly, and skulls that they are loathe to animate.  Any particular skull that is destroyed through damage may never again be used.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Fire Gate" id="Fire-Gate">
## Fire Gate
 
Magic-User 3

Range: Self and 50 yard/level

Duration: Instantaneous

In order for this spell to work, there need to be at least two large fires (a minimum of 2 to 4 ft in diameter) within range of each other. The maximum range was 50 yd/per level of the caster. If more than one such fire exists within range, then the caster can choose the destination. If no suitable destination is available, the spell fizzles and the caster is left standing in the fire.

Fire gate only transports the caster and what the caster is carrying and only provides temporary (1 round) of protection from the flames.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Fire Storm" id="Fire-Storm">
## Fire Storm

Cleric 7, Druid 7

Range: 100' + 10'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell causes an area 20’x10’x10’ per caster level to be filled with holy fire. The caster can determine the shape of the area, but the entire area must be contiguous. Any creature in the designated area takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any immunity or resistance to fire. Any creature that dies from the damage (or was already dead when the fire storm is cast) is completely consumed by the fire.  The fire only harms creatures and does not affect the surrounding environment.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Flame Strike" id="Flame-Strike">
## Flame Strike

Druid 5, Magic-User 5

Range: 60'

Duration: Instantaneoous

A **Flame Strike** produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high).  The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Flare" id="Flare">
## Flare

Magic-User 0

Range: 20' + 5'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

 A flash of light, a very small ball of fire, or a puff of colored smoke can be created by this cantrip. They will not typically last longer than a second.
 </div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Flavor" id="Flavor*">
 ## Flavor*

Magic-User 0

Range: 20' + 5'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This cantrip may either make one dish taste any way the caster wants it to (which is an illusion), or add salt, spice, sweetener, or another flavoring agent (which is real). Reversed, it becomes **Putrefy**, which makes the food or drink either go bad (which is real) or taste as if it had been prepared wrongly (which is an illusion).
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Flesh to Stone*" id="Flesh-to-Stone*">
## Flesh to Stone*
 
Magic-User 6

Range: 30'/level

Duration: Permanent

This spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear, to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs. Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

The reverse spell, **Stone to Flesh**, acts as a counterspell for **Flesh to Stone**, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not the result of **Flesh to Stone** or similar petrification effects (such as a medusa's gaze).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Floating Disc" id="Floating-Disc">
## Floating Disc

Magic-User 1

Range: 0

Duration: 5 turns +1/level

This spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield, being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable.

The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10' from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the surface beneath.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Fly" id="Fly">
## Fly
 
Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load.

If the spell duration expires while the subject is still airborne, the magic fails slowly such that the subject descends at a rate of 120 feet per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that time they land safely; if not, the subject falls the rest of the distance and suffers normal falling damage. However, if this spell is ended by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) or similar outside forces, the subject falls immediately. For any such fall, see [Falling Damage](combatDetails.qmd#falling-damage) for details of the consequences.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Forget" id="Forget">
## Forget

Magic-User 2

Range: 30'

Duration: Permanent

By means of this spell, the spellcaster causes creatures within a 20ft cube area of effect to forget the events of the previous six rounds (the one minute of time previous to the utterance of the spell). For every three levels of experience of the spellcaster, another minute of past time is forgotten. This does not negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells, but it is possible that the being who placed such magic upon the recipient could be forgotten.

From one to four creatures can be affected, at the discretion of the caster. If only one is to be affected, the recipient saves vs. spell with a -2 penalty; if two, they save with -1 penalties; if three or four are to be affected, they save normally. All saving throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A priest's heal or restoration spell, if specially cast for this purpose, will restore the lost memories, as will a limited wish or wish, but no other means will do so.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Forget Lightning" id="Forked-Lightning">
## Forked Lightning

Magic-User 2

Range: 25' + 5'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

Two arcs of electricity spring from the casters fingers to strike two separate adjacent targets within 10 foot of each other. For each bolt the caster must roll to hit their chosen target ignoring any worn armor and metal armored targets get +4 bonus to hit (any magical bonuses still apply). Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by this spell.

Each bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage +1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (round down). For every two levels past 3^rd^ (5^th^, 7^th^, 9^th^, etc) the caster gains an additional bolt of forked lightning. Subsequent targets (after first two) must be within 10 feet of the previously targeted foe, and a new attack roll must be made for each bolt. If there are fewer than the maximum allowed targets then the extra bolts do not appear and are wasted; a single bolt can only strike a single creature.

There is no save to resist the spell once struck by a bolt, but creatures with any sort of resistance to electrical attacks will suffer no damage whatsoever.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Fossilize" id="Fossilize">
## Fossilize
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

This spell permanently hardens the bones of one skeletal undead creature, making the bones denser and stronger.  The fossilized skeleton permanently gets +2 on damage rolls, +4 on its AC, and its damage resistance is enhanced.  A fossilized skeleton takes only quarter-damage from edged weapons, and half-damage from any other weapons.  The fossilized skeleton becomes immune to normal arrows, bolts, and bullets.  Magical missile weapons do only their 'plus' in damage.

While this spell is permanent, there is a drawback.  The  newly fossilized skeleton may not be repaired or otherwise 'healed', as the organic materials that made up the bones has been completely replaced by minerals.  Intelligent skeletal undead would not normally want this spell applied to themselves, but the spell would affect them nevertheless.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Gaseous Form" id="Gaseous-Form">
## Gaseous Form
 
Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The subject of this spell and all of their gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. The caster becomes immune to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical weapons. The subject can’t attack or cast spells while in gaseous form. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form.

A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10', and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the spell persists. The gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can’t enter water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the spell was cast. The subject can resume material form at will, but that will end the spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Gate" id="Gate">
## Gate

Cleric 7, Magic-User 7

Range: 120'

Duration: Special

This spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster’s location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.

The gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster's choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility.

The gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell's duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.

Note that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.

As long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the DM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Gentle Repose" id="Gentle-Repose">
## Gentle Repose

Cleric 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 3 months/level

This spell preserves the remains of a dead creature (including a zombie, if so desired). This prevents any decay of the remains for the duration of the spell. This extends the time limit imposed by raise dead, allowing for a longer time to cast the spells.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Ghoulish Hands" id="Ghoulish-Hands">
## Ghoulish Hands

Black Magic-User 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell causes the hands of one living creature to become like the horrible claws of ghouls.  The bearer of these ghoulish hands may make two claw attacks that cause 1d4 points of damage each.  If the recipient of this spell already had better claw attacks, then the caster gains a +2 damage bonus to their damage rolls while this spell is in effect.  In addition to the damage, those struck by the hands must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns (Elves are immune), exactly like the attacks of a ghoul.

Recipients of this spell must be true living creatures; other creatures such as undead, constructs, elementals, and the like are immune.  There is a 1% non-cumulative chance that on any particular casting of this spell that the recipient is actually infected with Ghoul Fever (per the monster description), which if proper curative steps are not taken, may ultimately result in the recipient's death and rising as an actual ghoul.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Gishigan's Geas*" id="Geas">
## Gishigan’s Geas*
 
Magic-User 6

Range: 5' per level

Duration: Special

**Gishigan’s Geas** places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the DM's discretion.

For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a --2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of --8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.

A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a [Remove] Curse(allSpells.html#remove-curse) spell, or by a **Wish**, or by the reverse of this spell. [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) does not affect a geas.
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Grave Sanctuary" id="Grave-Sanctuary">
## Grave Sanctuary
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

Similar to the Druid spell [Tree Sanctuary](allSpells.html#tree-sanctuary), this spell enables the caster to create an invisible entry into a grave, mausoleum, sarcophagus, large tombstone, or similar item associated with the repose of the dead.  The entry is visible to undead and other Black Magic-Users, but this does not grant any special access to the doorway.  Once the spell is complete, the Black Magic-User may enter the space, effectively disappearing from sight.  Only one grave may be effected by grave sanctuary at a time.

The Black Magic-User is completely aware of their surroundings while in the grave, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the site.  Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Black Magic-User rests inside the grave counts as a full hour of sleep, so the Black Magic-User may meditate to memorize spells while within the magical sanctuary.  Also, if the grave site is on unhallowed ground or an area otherwise associated with hauntings and the like, then the Black Magic-User heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the grave.

While inside the grave, the Black Magic-User does lose any sense of taste, smell, or touch, and may not speak or otherwise cast spells while inside the grave's protection.  If the grave itself is unearthed or broken into in some way, then the Black Magic-User takes 2d10 points of damage and is cast out into the nearest available space.  This kind of undertaking should be roughly equivalent to actually digging a grave up, and not simply an attack against the earth.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Greater Fear" id="Greater-Fear">
## Greater Fear

Black Magic-User 4

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell sends an invisible wave of fear out forward of the caster to a range of 30 feet.  Anyone in the area must save vs. Spells or be panicked.  A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary.  If cornered, the creature will cower in fear.  The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws.  The creature will do this for the duration of the spell.  If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Grease" id="Grease">
## Grease

Magic-User 1

Range: 10 yards

Duration: 1 turns +1/level

A grease spell covers a 10 x 10 ft material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can reach the nearest nongreased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured!

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item. The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise, it lasts for 1 turn plus one turn per level.
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Greater Teleport" id="Greater-Teleport">
## Greater Teleport

Magic-User 7

Range: Self

Duration: Instanteous

This spell functions in a similar fashion to the normal [Teleport](allSpells.html#teleport) spell, except that there is no limit to the range that can be spanned, nor is there any chance of arriving off target. In addition, the caster need not have seen the destination, if the caster has at least a reliable description of it. If the caster attempts to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), the caster disappears and then reappears in the original location. This spell cannot transport the caster to another plane of existence.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Growth of Animals" id="Growth-of-Animals">
## Growth of Animals

Cleric 3, Druid 3

Range: 60'+10'/level

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal's carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the DM's discretion).

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.

The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Growth of Plants*" id="Growth-of-Plants*">
## Growth of Plants*

Druid 4, Magic-User 6

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown.  The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a 10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels.  The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through.  All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate.  The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.

The reverse form, **Shrink Plants**, may be used to render overgrown areas passable.  The area of effect is identical to the normal version.

Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic).  This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Guidance*" id="Guidance">
## Guidance*

Cleric 0, Druid 0

Range: 10'

Duration: Instantaneous

The cleric grants +1 to any subject’s next attack roll. Reversed, this becomes **Misguide**, which gives the subject -1 to their next attack roll.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Guest of Wind" id="Gust-of-Wind">
## Gust of Wind

Druid 5, Magic-User 3

Range: 10' x 10 yds/level

Duration: 1 round/level

When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the caster and moves in the direction the caster is facing. The force of this [Gust of Wind](allSpells.html#gust-of-wind) (about 30 m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames--such as those of lanterns--to dance wildly and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spellcaster to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind's movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures.

Its path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8^th^-level wizard causes a [Gust of Wind](allSpells.html#gust-of-wind) that travels 80 yards).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Hallow*" id="Hallow">
## Hallow*

Cleric 0, Druid

Range: Self

Duration: Instantaneous

By chanting holy phrases, the caster makes the 0 foot radius area around him 'hallowed', granting +1 bonus on Healing spells and Turning attempts. The effect continues as long as the caster maintains the chant, but any action other than moving and defending oneself ends the effect. However, the effect lasts one additional round after the chant ends, giving the caster the option to cast or turn once and enjoy the effect himself.

The reverse, **Unhallow**, works in the same manner by granting +1 damage on Inflict spells (reversed healing) makes undead (or vile netherworld inhabitants) harder to Turn by one point (or optionally easier to Command by one point). It likewise lasts one round longer than the chant is maintained.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Hallucinatory Terrain" id="Hallucinatory-Terrain">

## Hallucinatory Terrain
Druid 4, Magic-User 4

Range: 400' + 40'/level

Duration: 2 turns/level

This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like).  This spell requires a full turn to cast.

The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain.  Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.  A save vs. Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Hannelore’s Rope Trick" id="Hannelores-Rope-Trick">
## Hannelore’s Rope Trick

Magic-User 4

Range: Touch

Duration: 4 turns/level

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space. The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them.

The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope. The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which they entered the extradimensional space.

The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Also note that creating or taking extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Haste*" id="Haste">

## Haste

Magic-User 3

Range: 30'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as normal, having double their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

Reversed, haste becomes **Slow**; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and slow counter and dispel each other.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Heal*" id="Heal">
## Heal*

Cleric 6, Druid 6

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Heal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue, [Feeblemind](allSpells.html#feeblement), insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all but 1d4 of the target's hit points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.

The reversed spell, **Harm**, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which **Harm** may kill a creature).

Generally, both **Heal** and **Harm** only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Heat Metal*" id="Heat-Metal">
## Heat Metal*

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: 25'

Duration: 7 rounds

This spell causes a single item made of ferrous (iron-based) metal to become hot for a brief period of time.  The affected item is warm to the touch immediately, and then becomes progressively hotter each round as indicated on the table below.  The damage roll indicated is applied to any creature holding or wearing the affected item; a brief touch does no damage.

Note that this spell can damage items harmed by heat, such as potions for example, and might boil water, wine, or oil stored in vessels within affected metal item, possibly causing an affected vessel to burst.  Generally this will happen on the 4^th^ or 5^th^ round, when the effect is at its most powerful.

| Round    | Temperature | Damage |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1^st^      | Warm        | None   |
| 2^nd^-3^rd^  | Hot         | 1d4    |
| 4^th^-5^th^  | Searing     | 2d4    |
| 6^th^      | Hot         | 1d4    |
| 7^th^      | Warm        | None   |

The reverse of this spell is **Chill Metal**.  It inflicts damage as outlined in the table above, but the damage is caused by cold instead of heat.  Note that this can freeze water, congeal oil, and so on.  Frozen water might burst its vessel.

Druid 3

Range: 180'

Duration: 2d8 turns

## Hold Person

Cleric 2, Magic-User 3

Range: 180'

Duration: 2d8 turns

This spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Hold Portal" id="Hold-Portal">
## Hold Portal

Magic-User 1

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A [Knock](allSpells.html#knock) spell or a successful [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) spell can negate a hold portal spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Ice Storm" id="Ice-Storm">
## Ice Storm
 
Magic-User 4

Range: 300'+30'/level

Duration: 1 round

This spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1 full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a 20' radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40', so creatures higher than that distance above the target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its save).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Iggwilv’s Mirror Image" id="Iggwilvs-Mirror-Image">
## Iggwilv’s Mirror Image

Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster.  The images move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real.  A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created.  These figments separate from the caster and remain in a cluster around them.  The figments mimic the caster's actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does.  Figments always look exactly like the caster.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a figment instead.  Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed.  Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Illusionary Wall" id="Illusionary-Wall">
## Illusionary Wall
 
Magic-User 4

Range: 30 yards

Duration: Permanent

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is permanent until dispelled. The area of effect is 1 x 10 x 10 ft. It appears absolutely real when viewed (even magically, as with the priest spell [True Seeing](allSpells.html#true-seeing) or its equivalent), but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, normal demihuman and magical detection abilities work normally, and touch or probing searches reveal the true nature of the surface, though they do not cause the illusion to disappear.
</div>

## Immunity to Normal Weapons
 
Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level

This spell temporarily makes the target immune to non-magical weapons. Anyone affected by this spell is treated as an enchanted creature for the purpose of magic, which specifically affects them (for instance, a sword +1, +3 vs. enchanted creatures applies its special bonus to a creature protected by this magic).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Improved Invisibility" id="Improved-Invisibility">
## Improved Invisibility
 
Magic-User 4

## Insect Plague

Cleric 5, Druid 5

Range: 300'+30'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18^th^ level. See Insect Swarm in the [Monsters](monstersAll.html#insect-swarm) section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Invisibility" id="Invisibility">
## Invisibility
 
Magic-User 2

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Invisibility 10' Radius" id="Invisibility-10-Radius">

## Invisibility 10' Radius
Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves, but if the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible (including any previously affected creatures who have become visible as described above).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Invisible Stalker" id="Invisible-Stalker">
## Invisible Stalker
 
Magic-User 6

Range: 0

Duration: Special

The caster summons an **Invisible Stalker** to do his or her bidding (see the [Monsters](monstersAll.html#invisible-stalker) section, below, for details). The spell persists until [Dispel Evil](allSpells.html#dispel-evil) is cast on the creature, it is slain, or the task is fulfilled. The DM is advised to review the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is used, as they may not always be reliable servants.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Jump" id="Jump">
## Jump

Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

The individual touched when this spell is cast is empowered to leap once per round for the duration of the spell. Leaps can be up to 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or backward have only a slight arc--about 2 feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The jump spell does not ensure safety in landing or grasping at the end of the leap.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Knock" id="Knock">
## Knock

Magic-User 2 

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, [Held](allSpells.html#hold-portal), or [Wizard Locked](allSpells.html#wizard-lock) doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a [Wizard Locked](allSpells.html#wizard-lock) door, the spell does not remove the [Wizard Locked](allSpells.html#wizard-lock) but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo a single means of preventing access.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Knot*" id="Knot">
## Knot*

Magic-User 0

Range: 30'

Duration: Intantaneous

This spell may tightly knot or tangle a rope, string, or similar object in any knot the caster would be able to tie. Reversed, the **Unknot** spell may undo any knot the caster could unknot himself.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Levitate" id="Levitate">
## Levitate
 
Range: Touch

Magic-User 2

Duration: 1 turn/level

Levitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round, by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Light*" id="Light">
## Light*

Cleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 turns + 1/level

This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30' radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20') around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

Reversed, **Light** becomes **Darkness**, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.

A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.

Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A **Light** or **Darkness** spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Lightning Bolt" id="Lightning-Bolt">
## Lightning Bolt
 
Magic-User 3

Range: 50'+10'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips and extends to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so.

The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the DM's option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Locate Object" id="Locate-Object">
## Locate Object

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as [Clairvoyance](allSpells.html#clairvoyance) or a **Crystal Ball**). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Locate Corpse" id="Locate-Corpse">
## Locate Corpse

Black Magic-User 1

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of the closest corpse or remains of a type usable for spells such as [Re-animation](allSpells.html#re-animation) or other similar spells.  Throughout the duration, the caster need simply concentrate on the general type of corpse (animal, humanoid, large size, etc) and of applicable state (intact, fresh, skeletal, etc).  The nearest remains fitting the criteria is located if more than one is within range.  Upon arrival at the location of the nearest corpse, the caster can again concentrate to locate another corpse, as long as the spell duration lasts. 

Specific remains belonging to a particular individual can be located with this spell, so long as the caster knew the individual personally during life.  This spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold.  Creatures, whether living or in states of undeath, cannot be found by this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Lower Water" id="Lower-Water">
## Lower Water

Druid 4, Magic-User 6

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch).  The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.  In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. 

When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a [Slow](allSpells.html#haste) spell (the reverse of **Haste**); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect.  The spell has no effect on other creatures.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Lusian's Terrible Transmutation" id="Lusians-Terrible-Transmutation">
## Lusian's Terrible Transmutation

Black Magic-User 5

Range: 20'

Duration: Special
 
This spell fused two different creatures into a single unique form, combining traits of both into the new form. This spell often does not function, and kills, creatures that possessed any magical abilities.

Both creatures needed to be within 20 feet of each other when the spell is cast and the new creature would appear where the larger creature was.
Both creatures are allowed a Saving throw. Any save negates the spell. A failed save rolls on the result table.

| Roll  | Description                              |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 1-5   | Total Failure resulting in death.        |
| 6-11  | Total Failure with minor consequences.   |
| 12-14 | Total Failure with minor consequences.   |
| 15-17 | Partial Success with minor consequences  |
| 18-20 | Successful fusion as planned.            |

Creatures possessing intelligence higher than that of an animal are likely to have their mind shattered during the casting (DC 15), resulting in an uncontrollable wild creation.
 
The resulting creature is likely not able to breed successfully unless Lusian's Join Animal was sealed with a [permanency](allSpells.qmd#permanency) spell.

History:

This spell was developed by Lusian the Transmuter, a powerful elven sorceress in the black arts from Imladris. Lusian called forth dark powers with binding rituals. She perverted nature – forging blood and sinew, forcing hoof and beak to meld as one, grafting wing with claw and fang to feather. So wicked was she that the goddess [Ki](gods.qmd#ki) bound her to a horrible fate.


<div class="spell" data-tag="Magic Armor" id="Magic-Armor">
## Mage Armor

Magic-User 1

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn

This spell creates a magical armor which protects the caster. The caster's skin becomes hard and stone-like, giving the caster a +2 bonus to armor class vs. melee attacks and hand-thrown missiles such as daggers or spears, and a +4 bonus to armor class vs. normal sized projectiles such as arrows, bolts, sling stones, and sling bullets.

Range: 40'

Duration: 10 rounds

A spectral hand is conjured, which may either move one pound of materials at a speed of 10 feet per round for ten rounds (at a maximum range of 40 feet), or give an object a powerful push about equal to the caster's strength at a range of 10 feet.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Magic Mirror" id="Magic-Mirror">
## Magic Mirror

Cleric 4, Magic-User 4

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 round/level

Turns a reflective surface within range into a magic mirror through which the caster can view other creatures. The caster must know and name the creature. The caster and any other creatures viewing the mirror will be able to see the images, but only the caster will hear sound from the viewing. Detection and vision spells can be cast into it with a 3% chance per caster level of success. If successful, this allows the caster to cast detect magic, see invisible, etc. through the mirror.
</div>


<div class="spell" data-tag="Magic Jar" id="Magic-Jar">
## Magic Jar
 
Magic-User 5

Range: 60'

Duration: Special

By casting **Magic Jar**, the caster places his or her soul in a gem or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar), leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.

To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her soul upon casting, the caster's body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.

Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil) or a similar ward. The subject is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell.

If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.

If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by [Dispel Evil](allSpells.html#dispel-evil): If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host's body dies.

If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. [Dispel Evil](allSpells.html#dispel-evil) can still be used to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell.

In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Magic Missile" id="Magic-Missile">
## Magic Missile

Magic-User 1

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from the caster's fingertip and strike its target, which must be at least partially visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every three caster levels beyond 1^st^, an additional missile is fired – two at 4^th^ level, three at 7^th^, four at 10^th^, and the maximum of five missiles at 13^th^ level or higher. If the caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is rolled.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Magic Mouth" id="Magic-Mouth">
## Magic Mouth

Magic-User 1

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long, can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6^th^-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Maggot Spray" id="Maggot-Spray">
## Maggot Spray
 
Black Magic-User 2

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 round/level

From the caster’s mouth sprays a stream of filth containing live flesh-eating maggots, affecting all within a 10-foot section immediately adjacent to and chosen by the caster. Those struck by the spray must save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (like the [Stench](allSpells.html#stench) spell, causing a penalty of -2 to their attacks).       Additionally, the maggots eat into the flesh, causing 1d4 points of damage immediately and on subsequent rounds an additional 1d4 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Individuals may stop the damage by using an entire round to brush off the maggots (no movement, attacks, and loss of any dexterity or shield bonuses during this round).  Those taking the time to brush off the maggots take normal damage that round.  Removing the maggots does not remove the sickening effect of those who failed their save.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Mask of Life" id="Mask-of-Life">
## Mask of Life
 
Black Magic-User 5

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell makes a single undead creature appear to be alive.  The caster can decide which race and style of clothes is worn by the undead creature.  The spell will also make the target’s movements appear life-like.  The illusion will create appropriate ambient effects (smells, sounds, clothing textures, and such) that would be expected for the life-like appearance. 

If the appearance is that of a living version of the target, anyone interacting with the target takes a -5 penalty to any saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.  If the target attacks or does anything that only the undead creature could do, the penalty is removed.

## Mass Invisibility

Magic-User 7

Range: 240'

Duration: Special

 This spell bestows the effect of an [Invisibility](allSpells.html#invisiblity) spell on all creatures within a 30' by 30' area, exactly as if each such creature had received its own spell; thus, each subject will remain invisible until the caster attacks or casts a spell, and will remain invisible after leaving the area of effect. As with the normal invisibility spell, this spell lasts at most 24 hours.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Massmorph" id="Massmorph">
## Massmorph

Magic-User 4

Range: 100'+10'/level

Duration: 1 hour/level

With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120' radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself among the affected creatures.

Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic).

## Melf’s Minute Meteors
 
Magic-User 3

Range: 70 yds. + 10 yds./level

Duration: Special

This spell enables the wizard to cast small globes of fire (one for each experience level the caster has attained), each of which bursts into a 1-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4 points of damage to the creature struck. These can ignite combustible materials. The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenade like missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within 3 feet.

The spell can be cast in either of two ways:

1) The wizard discharges all meteors in one round.

2) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can also perform other actions in the round, including spell casting, melee, or device use. Additional spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles.

The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as the caster has experience levels, when the caster forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster.

## Message
 
Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

When this spell is cast, the caster can whisper messages and receive replies with little chance of being overheard. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses each creature to be included in the spell effect (up to one creature per level). When the caster whispers, the whispered message travels in a straight line and is audible to all of the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus 10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that is heard by the spell caster. Note that there must be an unobstructed path between the caster and the recipients.

The message must be in a language the caster speaks; this spell does not by itself confer understanding upon the recipients. This spell is most often used to conduct quick and private conferences when the caster does not wish to be overheard.

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a saving throw vs. Spells. The sphere spreads around corners. Any affected creature takes 15d6 fire and bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Black Magic-User 2

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

This spell cloaks an object of less than 10 cubic feet with an invisible aura of harmful energy.  Thereafter, the first living creature touching the object sets off the ward, receiving 3d6 points of damage; no saving throw is allowed to avoid the damage.  The object is unaffected by the discharge of the minor ward.

Non-living creatures such as undead or golems will not set off a minor ward.  The caster is free to handle the object at will.  The maximum duration of the spell is 1 hour per level of the caster.

## Monster Summoning
 
Magic-User 4

Range: Special

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level

Within one round of casting this spell, the wizard magically conjures monsters (see list below).

The monsters appear anywhere within the spell's area of effect, as desired by the wizard. They attack the spell user's opponents to the best of their ability until either the caster commands that the attacks cease, the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.

These creatures do not check morale, but they vanish when slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if the wizard can communicate with them and if they are physically able, perform other services for the summoning wizard.

In rare cases, adventurers have been known to disappear, summoned by powerful spellcasters using this spell. Those summoned recall all the details of their trip.

## Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound

Magic-User 4

Range: 10  yards/level

Duration: Special

By means of this spell, the wizard summons up a phantom watchdog that only the caster can see. The caster may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real.

If the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends.

## Mordenkainen's Sword

Magic-User 7

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force.  The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as the caster desires, beginning in the round that the spell is cast.  The sword attacks its designated target once each round on the caster's normal initiative turn.  The sword attacks as a fighter of the same level as the caster, and the attack roll is modified by the caster's Intelligence bonus.    The sword inflicts 3d4 points of damage on a successful hit, and can hit even creatures immune to non-magical weapons.  On a natural roll of 19 or 20, it will automatically hit its target, no matter its armor class.  The sword can only be destroyed by a successful application of [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic).

<div class="spell" data-tag="Move Earth" id="Move-Earth">
## Move Earth

Druid 6

Range: 120'

Duration: Concentration (up to 2 hours)

The druid may choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range and reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner for the duration. The caster can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension.

So, if the caster affects a 40-foot square, the druid can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes spent concentrating on the spell, the druid can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Mummify" id="Mummify">
## Mummify
 
Black Magic-User 6

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 turn/level

After careful ceremonial preparations lasting five days, and the application of many rare and expensive unguents, the caster is able to call back the spirit of the dead to reanimate its corpse as a mummy.  Mummies so created are of the standard sort (see its [monster entry](monstersAll.html#mummy)).  Mummies do not count against the normal limits of controllable undead (per [Re-animation](allSpells.html#re-animation) spell), but the caster can maintain control over as many Hit Dice of mummies as their own level.

Mummies do not travel well, being slow and quickly wear down, taking damage on long journeys.  They make better guardians for the animator's lair.  A separate casting of the spell is necessary for each mummy created.  It might be possible to create a mummy from a large humanoid such as a giant, however the difficulty will be greater (the DM determines how much more difficult).  More powerful mummies, such as those with intact class-based powers, are generally created through the use of the undeath spell.

Mummification is generally in the realm of the Black Magic-User, but occasionally Clerics of certain cults might have access as well.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Neutralize Poison*" id="Neutralize-Poison">
## Neutralize Poison*

Cleric 4

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes **Poison**. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

This spell, when cast on a body of water, causes it to part.  This exposes a path that can be traversed as if it where dry land.  Note that this spell does not change the topography of the bottom of the body of water, so the terrain my still be difficult to cross.  The caster is able to affect a body of water up to 5 ft./caster level.  The caster may dismiss this spell at any time

<div class="spell" data-tag="Passwall" id="Passwall">
## Passwall
 
Magic-User 5

Range: 30'

Duration: 3 turns

Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9^th^ (20 feet at 12^th^, 30 feet deep at 15^th^, 40 feet deep at 18^th^). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic), or caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Permanency" id="Permanency">
## Permanency
 
Range: 10'

Magic-User 6

Duration: Permanent

This spell is used to make another spell of 6^th^ or lower level permanent. Only arcane magic can be affected: Clerical, Druidic, and other spells of divine nature can not be made permanent. No spell with a permanent or instantaneous duration can be made permanent.

A permanency spell lasts until dispelled. When it is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Casting a permanency spell causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution. Lost Constitution is recovered using the [Constitution Point Losses rules](combat.html#constitution-point-losses).

No more than two spells can be made permanent on a single person, item or place. If a third **Permanency** spell is cast it automatically fails, and there is a 50% that each of the two other permanency spells fails too.

A **Permanency** spell is not necessary to make any magical item; using permanency to bind a spell to an object, person, or place is not the same as crafting a magic item.

Spells that are commonly made permanent on a creature: [Detect Magic](allSpells.html#detect-magic), [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil), [Read Languages](allSpells.html#read-languages), [Read Magic](allSpells.html#read-magic), [Tongues](allSpells.html#tongues), [Detect Invisible](allSpells.html#detect-invisible), and [Fly](allSpells.html#fly).

Spells commonly made permanent on items or locations include: [Alarm](allSpells.html#alarm), [Animate Objects](allSpells.html#animate-objects), [Confusion](allSpells.html#confusion), [Dancing Lights](allSpells.html#dancing-lights), guards and wards, [Invisibility](allSpells.html#invisibility), [Phantasmal Force](allSpells.html#phantasmal-force), [Private Sanctum](allSpells.html#private-sanctum), [Magic Mouth](allSpells.html#magic-mouth), [Symbol of Pain](allSpells.html#symbol-of-pain),[Wall of Fire](allSpells.html#wall-of-fire), and [Web](allSpells.html#web).

<div class="spell" data-tag="Phantasmal Force" id="Phantasmal-Force">
## Phantasmal Force
 
Magic-User 2

Range: 180'

Duration: Concentration

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.

Attempting to animate more creatures than the caster's level grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be granted by the DM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Phase Door" id="Phase-Door">
## Phase Door

Magic-User 7

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 usage/2 levels

This spell creates a magical passage through a wall, the floor, the ceiling, or even through a section of ground. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the caster, who is the only one that can use the passage. The passage is 10 feet deep plus another 5 feet for every three caster levels.

The caster disappears when entering the phase door and appears when the caster exits. If desired, the caster can take one other creature through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor it is possible to see through it without using it.

A phase door is subject to [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic), but only from someone who is of higher level than the caster. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, the caster is harmlessly ejected (determine randomly in which direction).

It is possible to allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting a triggering condition for the door. This condition can be as simple or elaborate as desired. It can be based on a creature’s name or identity, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Plane Shift" id="Plane-Shift">
## Plane Shift

Cleric 5

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

 When cast, the caster or the creature touched is sent to another plane. If multiple creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight may plane shift. All participants must be willing. If any intended participant is unwilling, the spell fails with no effect. Plane shift is highly inaccurate and while the desired plane or dimension will always be reached, arrival will be 1-100 (d100) miles from the intended destination.
 </div>

 <div class="spell" data-tag="Plant Growth" id="Plant-Growth">
 ## Plant Growth

Druid 3

Range: Special

Duration: Permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines) within 400 ft. + 40 ft./caster level to become thick and overgrown.  The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through.  Movement rate is reduced to a maximum of 5 ft./round, or 10 ft for Large creatures.  The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect.  An area up to 100 ft radius may thus be altered.  Also, the caster may specify an area (a path, a clearing, etc.) within the given area of effect, which is not so affected.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures, that is, any self-willed and/or animated plant.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Polymorph Other" id="Polymorph-Other">
## Polymorph Other
 
Magic-User 4

Range: 30'

Duration: Permanent

This spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike [Polymorph Self](allSpells.html#polymorph-self), the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.

The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.

Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.

## Polymorph Self
 
Magic-User 4

Range: Self

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon's breath.

The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she desires (up to one hour per level, of course).

## Power Word Stun

Magic-User 7

Range: 120'

Duration: Variable

The caster utters a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of their choice to become stunned, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target’s current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 71 or more hit points is unaffected by power word stun. If the target has between 36 and 70 hit points, the duration is 1d6 rounds. If the target has 35 hit points or less, the duration is 2d6 turns.

## Private Sanctum
 
Magic-User 5

Range: 30'

Duration: 24 hours

This spell creates a field impenetrable to most kinds of scrutiny. Those looking into the area from outside see only a dark, foggy mass. [Darkvision](dungeonAdventures.html#darkvision) cannot penetrate it. Eavesdroppers do not perceive any sound, no matter how loud, emanating from the area. Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally. Anyone inside the affected area is immune to [ESP](allSpells.html#esp) spells.

Divination spells like [Magic Mirror](allSpells.html#magic-mirror), [Clairvoyance](allSpells.html#clairvoyance), and [Clairaudience](allSpells.html#clairvaudiance) cannot perceive anything within the area.

No speech is possible between those inside and those outside the sanctum. The spell does not prevent other means of communication, such as telepathic communication, or such as that between a Magic-User and a familiar.

Private sanctum does not stop creatures from moving into and out of the area.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Produce Flame/Cold" id="Produce-Flame-Cold">
## Produce Flame/Cold

Druid 2

Range: special

Duration: 6 rounds/level

Flames as bright as a torch appear in the caster’s open hand.  The flames don’t harm the caster or their equipment.  Alternatively, a bluish, cold aura may be produced, which also sheds light as bright as torch-light.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames or cold aura can be hurled or used to touch enemies.  The caster can strike an opponent with a melee [touch attack](combatDetails.qmd#touch-attack), dealing fire or cold damage respectively equal to 1d6, +1 points per caster level (maximum +5). 

Alternatively, the caster can hurl the flames or cold aura up to 50 ft as a thrown weapon.  When doing so, the caster must make an attack roll (with no range penalty), and on a successful hit deals the same damage as the melee attack.  As soon as the caster hurls the flames or cold aura, a new one appears in their hand.  Each attack made reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute.  If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends with that attack.

Neither variation of this spell functions underwater.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Projected Image" id="Projected-Image">
 ## Projected Image
 
Magic-User 6

Range: 240'

Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight between the caster and his or her illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. [Dimension Door](allSpells.html#dimension-door), [Teleport](allSpells.html#teleport), or any similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.

## Protection From Evil*

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of "evil" is left to the individual DM to decide.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a [Magic Jar](allSpells.html#magic-jar) attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the **Protection From Evil** effect. If the **Protection From Evil** effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are "evil" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes **Protection From Good**. It functions in all ways as described above, save that "good" creatures are kept away, rather than "evil" creatures.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Protection from Evil 10' Radius*" id="Protection-from-Evil-10-Radius">
## Protection From Evil 10' Radius*

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell functions exactly as [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil), but with a 10' radius rather than a 1' radius.  All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.

Reversed, this spell becomes **Protection From Good 10' Radius**, and functions exactly as the reversed form of [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil), except that it covers a 10' radius around the target rather than the normal 1' radius.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Protection from Fire" id="Protection-from-Fire">
## Protection From Fire

Druid 3

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

If the caster touches himself or herself, this spell grants temporary immunity to fire (normal and magic).  When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of magical fire damage, it is discharged.  Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

If the spell is cast upon another creature than the caster, **Protection From Fire** grants temporary immunity against normal fire.  The spell also offers a +4 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and if the save is successful, the creature suffers no damage (and only 25% if the save fails).  This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Protection from Lightning" id="Protection-from-Lightning">
## Protection From Lightning

Druid 4

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

 This spell functions exactly like [Protection From Fire](allSpells.html#protection-from-fire), except that that it protects against any sort of electrical or lightning damage.
 </div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Protection from Normal Missiles" id="Protection-from-Normal-Missiles">
## Protection from Normal Missiles

 
Magic-User 3

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Protection From Undead*" id="Protection-From-Undead">
## Protection From Undead*

Black Magic-User 1

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell works almost identically to the [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil) spell by warding a creature from attacks by undead creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures regardless of any moral or ethical leanings.  It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot.  The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and on saves.  Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by undead creatures or beings that the DM decides have a strong connection with death or undead.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a [Magic Jar](allSpells.html#magic-jar) attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects).  The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the **Protection from Undead** spell.  If the **Protection From Undead** effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature.  Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are undead or not).  This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.  The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes quite potent as **Protection From Living**.  It functions in all ways as described above, save that “living” creatures are kept away, rather than dead or “undead” creatures.  Black Magic-Users often use both versions of the spell to protect themselves from threats by both the living population as well as powerful undead that may try to command the Black Magic-User such as ghosts or vampires.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Purify Food and Water" id="Purify-Food-and-Water">
## Purify Food and Water

Cleric 1, Druid 1

Range: 10'

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Quest*" id="Quest">
## Quest*

Cleric 5

Range: 5'/level

Duration: Special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a [Remove Curse](allSpells.html#remove-curse) spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) does not affect a [Quest](allSpells.html#quest) spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Raise Dead*" id="Raise-Dead">
## Raise Dead*

Cleric 5

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1^st^ level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.

Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature which has become undead can't be raised by this spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reverse of this spell, **Slay Living**, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human, demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat.
</div>

<<div class="spell" data-tag="Ray of Exhaustion" id="Ray-of-Exhaustion">
## Ray of Exhaustion
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: 50'

Duration: 6 rounds/level

The caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any dexterity bonus).  If the narrow black ray hits, the target must save vs. Spells or suffer a -6 adjustment to its Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell.  If the save is made, the reduction is only -2.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Read Languages" id="Read-Languages">
## Read Languages

Magic-User 1

Range: 0

Duration: Special

This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:

In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.

This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see [Read Magic](allSpells.html#read-magic), for the correct spell to use in such cases.

The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Read Magic" id="Read-Magic">
## Read Magic

Magic-User 0

Range: 0'

Duration: Permanent

All Magic-Users are able to read magic.

When cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text.  Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse.  All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to their spellbook.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Re-Animation" id="Re-Animation">
## Re-Animation
 
Black Magic-User 4

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

Virtually identical to the [Animate Dead](allSpells.html#animate-dead) spell, this spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken commands.  They remain animated until they are destroyed.  The Black Magic-User may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to three times their caster level, and no more.  Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased.  Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life.  An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly-intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly-intact corpse.

The caster must touch the remains to be animated.  The caster may control no more hit dice of undead than 6 times their level.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Regenerate" id="Regenerate">
## Regenerate

Cleric 6, Druid 7

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.

This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Reincarnate" id="Reincarnate">
## Reincarnate

Druid 6, Magic-user 6

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return.  If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes:


| d%  | Incarnation            |
|-----|------------------------|
| 01–02  | Bugbear                |
| 03–17  | Dwarf                  |
| 18–28  | Elf                    |
| 29     | Gnoll                  |
| 30–39  | Gnome                  |
| 40–44  | Goblin                 |
| 45–63  | Halfling               |
| 64–88  | Human                  |
| 89–92  | Kobold                 |
| 93     | Lizard Man             |
| 94–98  | Orc                    |
| 99     | Troglodyte             |
| 100    | Other (DM's choice)    |

Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired.  The condition of the remains is not a factor.  So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death.  The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand.  This process takes one hour to complete.  When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form.  Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled.   (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the DM as needed.)  The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration.  Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points.  If the subject was 1^st^ level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.

A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell.  Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated.  The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.

</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Remove Curse*" id="Remove-Curse*">
## Remove Curse*

Cleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 4

Range: 30'

Duration: Instantaneous

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.

The reverse of this spell, **Bestow Curse**, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:

--4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

--4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.

Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a **Remove Curse** spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Remove Fear*" id="Remove-Fear">
## Remove Fear*

Cleric 1

Range: Touch (120')

Duration: Instantaneous (2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, **Cause Fear**, causes one target creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Remove Paralysis" id="Remove-Paralysis">
## Remove Paralysis

Cleric 2

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell permits the caster to free the creature touched from paralysis induced either by magical means or by monster attack (e.g. venom or ghouls)
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Resist Cold" id="Resist-Cold">
## Resist Cold

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Resist Fire" id="Resist-Fire">
## Resist Fire

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a [Fireball](allSpells.html#fireball)), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Restore Health" id="Restore-Health">
## Restore Health

Cleric 2

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell removes unnatural weakness, mental or physical debilitation or exhaustion from the touched individual. This spell is useful for restoring temporary ability score draining, such as the strength-draining touch of a shadow. The caster chooses which ability score the spell will restore when casting. It has no effect on permanent ability score loss or energy drain.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Restoration*" id="Restoration">
## Restoration*

Cleric 6, Druid 7

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16^th^ level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the [Healing](healingAndInjuries.qmd#energy-drain) section) for more details.

Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.

Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for the spell [Raise Dead](allSpells.html#raise-dead)).

The reverse, **Energy Drain**, draws away one life energy level like a wight. The energy drain requires the victim to be touched.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Resurrection" id="Resurrection">
## Resurrection

Cleric 7

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased creature. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than ten years per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

This spell operates similarly to raise dead, but is more powerful. The full body is not required; only a small portion is required, but that portion must have been part of the subject’s body at the time of death. (The dust left from a disintegrate spell counts as the required small portion.) A whole new body is created, so it will be at the peak of health, with full hit points, and all spells prepared at the time of death.

This is still an ordeal, however. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is resurrected, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1^st^ level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.

A creature which has become undead can be resurrected as long as the undead creature has been destroyed. Constructs and elementals cannot be resurrected.

The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Reveal Magic" id="Reveal-Magic">
## Reveal Magic
 
Magic-User 6

Range: 5'

Duration: 1 minute

This spell reveals all spell and magical properties of an object, creature, or permanently enchanted area examined with this spell. The caster must examine the object, creature, or location for an entire minute. In the case of a magic item, the caster will learn all of its functions, how to activate it (if required), and any charges left (if it has charges). If it is an object or creature with spells cast on it, or an enchanted area, the caster will learn what spells, their effects, and the caster level of those spells.

Any object or magic item that is held by someone who does not want the object or magic item examine may negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells. Likewise a creature that does not want to be examined may also negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Reverse Gravity" id="Reverse-Gravity">
## Reverse Gravity

Druid 7, Magic-User 7

Range: 5 yds/level

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell reverses gravity in a 30’ x 30’ area of effect, causing all unattached objects and creatures within it to “fall” upward. The reverse gravity lasts as long as the caster desires or until the spell expires. If some solid object is encountered in this “fall,” the object strikes it in the same manner as it would during a normal downward fall. At the end of the spell duration, the affected objects and creatures fall downward. As the spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, or even thousands of feet in the air above the area can be affected.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Shrink Item" id="Shrink-Item">
## Shrink Item
 
Magic-User 4

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

By means of this spell, the wizard is able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/12 of its normal size. Optionally, the caster can also change its now-shrunken composition to a cloth like one. An object in the possession of another creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Objects changed by an **Shrink Item** spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original spellcaster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Ring of Greater Healing*" id="Ring-of-Greater-Healing">
## Ring of Greater Healing*

Cleric 7, Druid 7

Range: 15' radius

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell [Cure Serious Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-serious-wounds) affecting multiple creatures within a 15' radius. This spell thus cures 3d6+3 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.

The reverse of this spell, **Ring of Greater Infliction**, allows the caster to cast [Cause Serious Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-serious-wounds) on multiple creatures within a 15' radius. This form of the spell causes 3d6+3 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.

## Ring of Lesser Healing*

Cleric 5, Druid 5

Range: 15' radius

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell [Cure Light Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds) affecting multiple creatures within a 15' radius. This spell thus cures 1d6+1 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.

The reverse of this spell, **Ring of Lesser Infliction**, allows the caster to cast [Cause Light Wounds](allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds) on multiple creatures within a 15' radius. This form of the spell causes 1d6+1 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Rock to Mud*" id="Rock-to-Mud">
## Rock to Mud*

Druid 5, Magic-User 5

Range: 150'

Duration: Permanent

This spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud; up to two 10 ft cubes per caster level may be so transformed.  Magical stone is not affected by this spell.  The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 ft.  A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 ft and causing it to suffer a ‑2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and armor class.  Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 ft., suffering none of the other penalties given.

If rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool to a depth of 5 ft.  The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since **Rock to Mud** cannot affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such a buildings’ foundation.  However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.

The mud remains until a successful [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) or **Mud to Rock** spell restores its substance (though not necessarily its form).  Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.  The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

When using the reverse, **Mud to Rock**, the spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently.  Any creature in the mud must save vs. Death Ray to escape before the area transforms into rock (assuming it has enough movement to do so).

<div class="spell" data-tag="Rot Flesh" id="Rot-Flesh">
## Rot Flesh

Black Magic-User 4

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell works exactly like the [Decay Flesh](allSpells.html#decay-flesh) spell, save that it deals 2d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level to the creature affected by it.  The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage.  A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or a number of rounds equal to the caster's level have passed.

Just like the lower level [Decay Flesh](allSpells.html#decay-flesh) spell, this spell may not be reversed, and similarly, this spell works upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed for 2d6 points plus 1 point per caster level worth of damage instead.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Sacrifice*" id="Sacrifice">
## Sacrifice*

Cleric 3

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows the cleric to transfer any desired number of hit points from himself to the target. The reverse of this spell, **Drain Life**, allows the caster to drain 1d6+1 hp from a creature, with a successful attack roll. The hit points are transferred to the cleric through healing.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Sanctuary" id="Sanctuary">
## Sanctuary

Cleric 1

Range: Self

Duration: 2 round + 1 round/level

This spell causes opponents to ignore the caster. Any opponent who might otherwise wish to attack or harm the caster must make a successful saving throw vs. Spells in order to do so; if this save fails, that opponent will behave as if the caster is not important and move on to whatever activity it would normally do if the caster were not present.

This spell does not prevent area effect attacks (fireball, ice storm, etc.) from harming the caster. While under protection from the spell, the caster is unable to perform any offensive acts, but may take any other action desired.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Shadow Staff" id="Shadow-Staff">
## Shadow Staff
 
Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

The caster's staff is transformed into the substance of shadow. When used in combat the staff is treated as a magical weapon (initially +1 to hit and damage) and each hit will drain 1 point of strength from the target (save vs. Spells to avoid). For each point drained, the staff's magical bonus is increased by one (up to a maximum bonus of +5), lasting until the end of the spell. The shadow staff can only be wielded by the caster. The draining effect does combine with any inherent magical qualities of the caster's staff, if such exist. Use best magical bonus, either the magical staff's inherent bonus or the magic from the spell's draining ability, whichever is better on any particular round (as the bonus from the spell can potentially increase over time to become better than the inherent magical ability of the staff in question).
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Shadow Walk" id="Shadow-Walk">
## Shadow Walk
 
Magic-User 6

Range: Touch (see text)

Duration: 1 hour/level

Shadow Walk can only be cast in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and up to one willing creature per level are transported to the ethereal plane. In this region of shadow, the caster (and all the creatures that accompany them) moves at an effective rate of 50 miles per hour.

Because of the blurring of reality, the caster can’t make out details of the terrain or areas the caster passes over during transit, nor can the caster predict perfectly where the travel will end. When the spell effect ends, the caster and any creatures accompanying them arrives 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint.

The caster and their companions always arrive at ground level, except if the landing area is in a body of water (in which case they arrive at the water level) or underground. If arriving underground, the altitude of arrival should be as close as possible to the same altitude as the intended endpoint location.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Shield" id="Shield">

Magic-User 1

Range: Self

Duration: 5 rounds+1/level

Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the caster. It negates [Magic Missile](allSpells.html#magic-missile) attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but  [Magic Missile](allSpells.html#magic-missile) are warded off from all directions.

## Shield of Thorns

Druid 2

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

Thick vines and thorny protrusions grow up and around the spell caster, hardening to provide protection and discouraging attacks. The wooden vine “armor” provides a +4 bonus to armor class. In addition, those attempting to strike the caster in close combat (melee attack) must save vs. Death Ray or take 1d4 point of damage from the thorns.

Those attacking with weapons of length, such as spears or polearms, will not suffer such damage.

## Silence 15' Radius

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: 360'

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Sleep" id="Sleep">
## Sleep
 
Magic-User 1

Range: 90'

Duration: 5 rounds/level

This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the effect.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures, and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.

When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally, at the DM's option.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Speak with Animals" id="Speak-with-Animals">
## Speak with Animals

Cleric 2, Druid 2

Range: Special

Duration: 1 turn/4 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Speak with Monsters" id="Speak-with-Monsters">
## Speak with Monsters

Cleric 6, Druid 6

Range: Special

Duration: 1 turn/5 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Speak with Plants" id="Speak-with-Plants">
## Speak with Plants

Cleric 4, Druid 4

Range: 20'

Duration: 1 turn

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform “services” other than to answer questions.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Speak with Dead" id="Speak-with-Dead">
## Speak with Dead

Cleric 3

Range: 10'

Duration: 3 rounds/level

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to **Speak with Dead** within the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

Magic-User 7

Range: 0'

Duration: 6 turns

This abjuration reflects 3^rd^ Level or lower spells back at the caster.

If it is Casting a Spell of 4^th^ Level or higher, the Magic-User makes a DC check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level – Int bonus. On a success, the spell is reflected.

Spell turning can't affect spells that aren't targeted (such as area spells).
If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who is also under the effect of spell turning, their spell turning can attempt to reflect their own spell back at you again; if they do so, their counteract attempt automatically succeeds

<div class="spell" data-tag="Spider Climb" id="Spider-Climb">
## Spider Climb
 
Magic-User 1

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 turn/level

A **Spider Climb** spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner, at a their usual walking movement rate.

During the course of the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weigh less than a dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to their hands and feet. Thus, a wizard will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell effect with a word

<div class="spell" data-tag="Spirit Wrack" id="Spirit-Wrack">
## Spirit Wrack
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: Special

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to any one particular incorporeal undead being such as wraiths, spectres, ghosts, or similar entities within sight of the caster.  Alternatively, the caster may choose to cause a burst of 1d4 points of damage per level to any such beings within 20 feet of the caster, whether visible or not. 

Minor spiritual beings such as poltergeists haunting an area are usually destroyed outright by this spell.  Any affected being is allowed a save for half damage.  Some persistent types of undead may reform after the passage of some time (typically days later), and may require certain rituals or other requirements be fulfilled before being permanently destroyed.  This spell only affects true incorporeal undead and does nothing against other types of beings, even if they happen to be insubstantial at the time; vampires that happen to be in gaseous form are immune to this spell's effect.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Spiritual Hammer" id="Spiritual-Hammer">
## Spiritual Hammer

Cleric 2

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster's normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispell-magic), [Disintegrate](allSpells.html#disintegrate), or a **Rod of Cancellation** will dispel it.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Stench" id="Stench">
 ## Stench
 
Black Magic-User 1

Range: Self

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell creates a sickly stinking smell of rot and decay that emanates from the caster's body.  The stench duplicates the sickening effect of ghasts ([see its entry in the Monster section](monstersAll.html#ghoul-and-ghast)).  The smell of death and corruption surrounding the caster is so overwhelming that living creatures within 10 feet must succeed a save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). 

For every three levels the caster has, a penalty of ‑1 on the save is applied to those affected (at 3^rd^ the save is at -1, at 6^th^ level at -2, at 9^th^ level at -3, etc).  A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by this spell or a ghast’s stench for 24 hours.  A [Neutralize Poison Spell](allSpells.html#neutralize-poison-spell) removes the effect from a sickened creature.

This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the [Monsters](monstersAll.html#snake-giant-rattlesnake) section for details on types of snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Stone Shape" id="Stone-Shape">
## Stone Shape

Cleric 4, Druid 4

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to shape, bend, and form an existing piece of stone (of up to 10 cubic ft + 1 cubic ft per level) into any shape the caster wishes.

Fine detail is not possible but primitive doors, walls, bridges, or similar items can be created with this spell. Stone shaped in the form of moving or mechanical parts will not work on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6.

Duration: 1 turn/level

Protects the caster. The caster's skin becomes hard and stone-like, protecting the caster by absorbing the first 10 points/level of damage from all attacks. (This operates like [hardness](combat.html#attacking-a-vehicle).) Once the spell has absorbed 10 points of damage per caster level, the spell is discharged.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Striking" id="Striking">
## Striking

Cleric 3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.

This spell summons 1d8 ordinary animals (including giant ones) of no more than 4 HD each if they are within range.  The Druid must name the type of animal summoned, and can have up to three choices.  If none of the three species are found within range, the spell fails.  The animals will be friendly when summoned and aid the Druid's current task, including combat, in whatever way they can (to the best of their understanding).  The Druid may dismiss any animals called by this spell at any time.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Summon Spirit" id="Summon-Spirit">
## Summon Spirit
 
Black Magic-User 3

Range: 10'/level

Duration: 1 turn/level

Upon casting this spell, a malevolent spirit in the form of a wraith is called to serve the caster for 1 turn per level.  If the caster is 10^th^ level the caster may choose between 1d4 wraiths or one spectre.  At 15^th^ level the caster may opt to summon 2d4 wraiths, 1d3 spectres, or one ghost.  The summoned spirits will serve according to its ability, usually by combating the caster's foes, and generally disappearing at the end of the spell's duration.

Occasionally the spirit does not depart at the end of the spell duration, but simply becomes free of the compulsion to serve and will usually attack the caster.  The chance is 5% for any particular wraith, 10% for spectres, and 20% for a ghost.  When this occurs, the spirit will remain in the area for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level before departing.  A spirit with less than half its hit points will not stay regardless.  The caster would be wise to have protections or other contingencies against the rogue spirits.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Summon Swarm" id="Summon-Swarm">
## Summon Swarm

Druid 1, Magic-User 2

Range: 60 Yards

Duration: Special

The swarm of small animals (roll on following table to determine type, or the DM can assign an appropriate creature) drawn by the summon swarm spell will viciously attack all creatures in a 10 ft by 10ft  area chosen by the caster. Creatures actively defending against the swarm to the exclusion of other activities suffer 1 point of damage for each round spent in the swarm. Those taking other actions, including leaving the swarm, receive damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per three levels of the caster each round. Note that spellcasting within the swarm is impossible.

| Dice Roll | Swarm Type           |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 01-40     | Rats                 |
| 41-70     | Bats                 |
| 71-80     | Spiders              |
| 81-90     | Centipedes/beetles   |
| 91-100    | Flying insects       |

The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and area effects can force it to disperse by inflicting damage. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. A [Protection From Evil](allSpells.html#protection-from-evil) spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as [Gust of Wind](allSpells.html#gust-of-wind) and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (for example, only flyers are affected by a [Gust of Wind](allSpells.html#gust-of-wind)). The caster must remain stationary and undisturbed to control the swarm; if their concentration lapses or is broken, the swarm disperses in two rounds. The swarm is stationary once conjured.

This cantrip/orison summons one small, totally ordinary insect (such as a beetle, fly, or spider), a small rodent (such as a field mouse), or a cloud of gnats into a certain area. If targeted intelligently, the spell may be able to disrupt spellcasting, but will never deal any actual damage (including poison) to the target. Reversed, this cantrip becomes **Exterminate**, which may kill any one creature of similar size as the ones described in the spell.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Symbol of Fear" id="Symbol-of-Fear">
## Symbol of Fear
 
Black Magic-User 6

Range: Special

Duration: Special

This spell functions like [Symbol of Pain](allSpells.html#symbol-of-pain), except that all creatures within 60 feet of the **Symbol of Fear** become panicked for 1 round per caster level.  A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary.  If cornered, the creature will cower in fear.  The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws.  The creature will do this for the duration of the spell.  If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Symbol of Pain" id="Symbol-of-Pain">
## Symbol of Pain

Black Magic-User 5

Range: Special

Duration: Special

With this spell, the caster writes a potent rune on a surface.  When triggered each creature within 60 feet of the **Symbol of Pain** are wracked with pain.  This pain imposes a -4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.  These effects last for as long as the creature stays within range of the symbol, and for 1 hour after leaving the area.

Once triggered, the symbol will remain active for 1 turn per caster level.  After that the symbol is discharged.  A symbol is permanent until discharged; it may be removed by [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) that targets the rune specifically.

The symbol is triggered by one or more of the following, as determined by the caster: a victim looks at the rune, reads the rune, touches the rune, or passes near the rune.  Regardless of the triggering methods, it cannot be triggered by a creature more than 60 feet away.  Once the spell is cast, the trigger methods cannot be changed.

Triggering methods can be further modified by qualifiers, type of creature, race of creature, number of creatures, skip some number of triggers (so it is the third creature to touch it, not the first or second), or any other qualifier that is based on observable actions or details.

The symbol may also be assigned a password that will temporarily disable the symbol when the password is said as a creature enters the range of the symbol.  Each time the range is entered, the password must be said again or the symbol will go off.  This is set at the time of casting and cannot be changed.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Telekinesis" id="Telekinesis">
## Telekinesis
 
Magic-User 5

Range: Self

Duration: 3 turns

This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In order to use this power, the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.
</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Teleport" id="Teleport">
## Teleport
 
Magic-User 5

Range: Self

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10^th^. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's possession from being teleported.

The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

| False destination | -- | -- | 81--92 | 93--100 |

Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. "Studied carefully" is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. "Seen casually" is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic.

"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.

On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.

Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten "scrambled." Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

## Tongues

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell allows the creature touched to speak and understand any language or dialect. Only one language can be spoken at a time, but any number can be understood. This spell does not alter other creatures’ dispositions and does not allow the affected creature to speak to creatures that cannot understand language.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Trap the Soul" id="Trap-the-Soul">
## Trap the Soul

Magic-User 7

Range: 10 yards

Duration: Permanent until broken

This spell forces the creature's life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.

The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.

The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A [Sympathy](allSpells.html#sympathy) spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.

The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.

Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10^th^-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Tree Santuary" id="Tree-Santuary">
## Tree Sanctuary

Druid 4

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell enables a Druid to create an invisible door in the trunk of a tree that is visible only to dryads and other Druids.  The tree must be at least 10 ft tall and planted into the earth for this spell to work.  Once the spell is complete, the Druid may enter the tree, effectively disappearing from sight.  Only one tree may be affected by tree sanctuary at a time.  Furthermore, this spell may only be cast on a tree occupied by a dryad if the dryad allows it.

The Druid is completely aware of their surroundings while in the tree, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the tree.  The Druid may meditate to memorize spells in the tree.  Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Druid sleeps inside the tree counts as a full hour of sleep.  Also, if the tree is an oak, the Druid heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the tree.

The Druid however loses the senses of taste, smell, and touch, and may not speak or cast spells while inside the tree.  The Druid takes half of any damage the tree suffers, and if the tree is destroyed or cut down, the Druid is cast out into the nearest available space.

<div class="spell" data-tag="True Seeing" id="True-Seeing">
## True Seeing

Cleric 5, Druid 5

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

**True seeing**, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a **Crystal ball** or in conjunction with [Clairvoyance](allSpells.html#clairvoyance).

This spell destroys 3d12 hit dice or levels of undead creatures in a 30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit).  Excess levels of effectiveness are lost.  Each undead creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save are immediately destroyed.

An unseen servant is an invisible servant that is shapeless and mindless. It can be used to fetch things, return things, open doors, hold chairs, clean things, and mend things. It is not strong, having an effective strength of 3. It can only open normal doors, chests, lids, containers, and such subject to its minimal strength. The servant cannot fight, nor can it be destroyed, but it can always be dismissed at any time prior to the spell’s end.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Vanish" id="Vanish">
## Vanish

Magic-User 7

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

When the wizard employs this spell, the caster causes an object to vanish (i.e., to be teleported as if by a [Teleport](allSpells.html#teleport) spell) if it weighs no more than 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a 14^th^-level caster can vanish, and cause to reappear at a desired location, an object up to 700 pounds in weight. The maximum volume of material that can be affected is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus, both weight and volume limit the spell. An object that exceeds either limitation is unaffected and the spell fails.

If desired, a vanished object can be placed deep within the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object vanished remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) spell cast on the point will bring the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane. Note that creatures and magical forces cannot be made to vanish.

There is a 1% chance that a vanished item will be disintegrated instead. There is also a 1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal Plane is able to gain access to the Prime Material Plane through the vanished item's connection.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wall of Bones" id="Wall-of-Bones">
## Wall of Bones
 
Black Magic-User 4

Range: 10'/level

Duration: 1 round/level

An immobile wall of writhing interlocking bone and bone fragments rises from the earth.  The wall is composed of up to one 10-foot x 10-foot square section, 1 foot thick, per caster level.  Unlike the similar spell, [Wall of Stone](allSpells.html#wall-of-stone), the caster may not double the wall’s area by halving its thickness, as the structure is already very porous and would lose its structural integrity, but of course the wall can be made thicker.  For instance, a 10^th^-level caster could conjure a section to fill in a 10-foot cube (10 feet x 10 feet x 1 foot, 10 sections thick).  The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.  The wall does not require concentration to maintain, but falls to pieces at the end of the spell duration.

The spell also differs from the [Wall of Stone](allSpells.html#wall-of-stone) spell in that  the semi-animated wall attacks those within close proximity to its structure (10 feet) for 2d4 piercing and slashing damage from the bones.  The structure is not completely solid, so high-strength individuals may attempt to break through with a Strength check, but they take an additional 2d6+1/level points of damage while making the attempt for each 1 foot of thickness that they attempt to move through.  A separate Strength check is necessary for each 1 foot of thickness of the wall section in order to break through.  The bone wall does not attack the caster or any undead creatures.  The **Wall of Bones** may be fashioned into simple structures such as ramps or bridges to span a rift, but these uses reduce the size by half so that supporting arches or buttresses can be included.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wall of Fire" id="Wall-of-Fire">
## Wall of Fire

Cleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 4

Range: 180'

Duration: 1 round/level (or special)

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster's turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.

The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.
</div>

## Wall of Force

Magic-User 7

Range: 180'

Duration: 1 round/level (or special)

This spell creates an invisible wall of force up to 100 feet square. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks the surface, the spell fails. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic). [Dimension Door](allSpells.html#dimension-door), [Misty Step](allSpells.html#misty-step) and [Teleport](allSpells.html#teleport) can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at their option.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wall of Iron" id="Wall-of-Iron">
## Wall of Iron
 
Range: 90'

Magic-User 6

Duration: Permanent

This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wall of Stone" id="Wall-of-Stone">
## Wall of Stone

Cleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 5

Range: 15'/level

Duration: Permanent

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces.  The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, 1' thick, per caster level.  The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness.  The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.

The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape the caster desires.  The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.  It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.  For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half.  The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.  Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wall of Thorns" id="Wall-of-Thorns">
## Wall of Thorns

Druid 7

Range: 15'/level

Duration: Permanent

This spell creates a wall of tough, tangled brambles bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. If the subject fails its save vs. Spells it is Entangled and held immobile, suffering a -2 penalty to hit and a -4 penalty to its armor class. In addition, the thorny growths cause 1d8 points of damage to the target each round. An individual so entangled may only cast spells if a DC 15 is achieved, modified by their primary spell casting ability score bonus.

A creature can move through the wall ay 5’ per round suffering 1d8 points of damage.

## Warp Wood*

Magic-User 2, Druid 2

The caster causes non-magical wood in a 20 ft radius to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength.  A warped door springs open or becomes stuck; a boat or ship springs a leak; warped weapons (like bows and arrows) are useless.  The caster may warp wood object(s) up to 1 ft on all sides per caster level.

Alternatively, the caster can **“Un-Warp”** non-magical wood (effectively warping it back to normal), straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means.  The caster can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or un-warp) an object that is too large to warp with a single spell.

</div>

<div class="spell" data-tag="Web" id="Web">
## Web
 
Range: 10' per level

Magic-User 2

Duration: 2 turns/level

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10'x10'x10' cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.

Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the DM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wind Walk" id="Wind-Walk">
## Wind Walk

Cleric 7, Druid 7

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 hour/level

This spell alters the substance of the caster’s body to a cloud-like vapor (as the [Gaseous Form](allSpells.html#gaseous-form) spell) and the caster can move through the air, potentially at great speed. Other creatures can be touched by the caster, which causes them to be affected by the spell, too, each of whom acts independently. Up to one additional person per three caster levels my be included in the spell.

While under the spell, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet, able to move any direction at any time. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round, but maneuverability becomes very poor. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.

For the duration of the spell, each participant may freely switch between its physical form and its vaporous form as desired, but each change takes five rounds. The caster can dismiss the spell at any time, either individually or for everyone at once.

With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye” through which he or she can see. The eye has [Darkvision](dungeonAdventures.html#darkvision), but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240' away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40' per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240' feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Word of Recall" id="Word-of-Recall">
## Word of Recall

Cleric 6, Druid 6

Range: Self (special)

Duration: Instantaneous

Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10^th^. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported.

<div class="spell" data-tag="Wraithform" id="Wraithform">
## Wraithform

Magic-User 2

Range: Self

Duration: 3 rounds/level

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Undead of most sorts will ignore an individual in wraithform, believing him to be a wraith or spectre, though a lich or special undead may save vs. spell with a -4 penalty to recognize the spell.

The wizard can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all the caster wears or holds in their hands, as long as the spell persists. Note, however, that the caster cannot fly without additional magic. No form of attack is possible when in wraithform, except against creatures that exist on the Ethereal Plane, where all attacks (both ways) are normal. A successful [Dispel Magic](allSpells.html#dispel-magic) spell forces the wizard in wraithform back to normal form. The spellcaster can end the spell with a single word.

The caster of this spell will be sheathed in a pale, glowing aura which confers the effect of an [Anti-Magic Shell](allSpells.html#anti-magic-shell) (as the spell). In addition, any magic cast upon or including the caster in its area of effect is affected as follows:

Spells directly targeting the caster (like [Magic Missile](allSpells.html#magic-missile)) will be deflected. Roll 1d6; on 1-2, the magic is reflected back at the offending caster. Otherwise, it is deflected at a random target.

 

Area effect magic is altered as follows (roll 1d10):

 
| Roll | Effect |
