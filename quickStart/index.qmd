## Introduction

Beginner's Essentials offers the key information new players need to quickly create and start playing first level characters in a World of OnceWas role-playing game. This guide does not include all the information required to run a World of OnceWas adventure or campaign. The Game Master should have a copy of the World of OnceWas Role-Playing Game Core Rules, which contains the complete set of rules. The rulebook is available for download at [oncewarerpg.com](https://oncewasrpg.com/). Once characters advance to the second level, players will also need to reference the Core Rules.
