<p>Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Range: 20’ + 10’/level</p>
<p>Duration: 2 hours/level</p>
<p>Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time any creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the caster at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. The caster decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.</p>
<p>Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster (and only the caster) so long as the caster remains within 1 mile of the warded area. The caster will hear a single mental “ping” sufficient to awaken the caster from normal sleep, but which does not otherwise disturb concentration. A <a href="allSpells.html#silence-15-radius">Silence</a> spell has no effect on a mental alarm.</p>
<p>Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 ft of the warded area can hear it clearly. Interposing doors or walls may reduce the distance by 10 ft or 20 ft. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a <a href="allSpells.html#silence-15-radius">Silence</a> spell cannot hear the ringing.</p>
<p>Incorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm.</p>

<p>When this spell is cast, the wizard can alter their appearance and form–including clothing and equipment–to appear taller or shorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster’s body can undergo a limited physical alteration and their size can be changed up to 50%.</p>
<p>The caster’s Hit Points, attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, or defenses. Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. The caster can change back into their own form at will; this ends the spell immediately. A caster who is slain automatically returns to their normal form.</p>

<p>Range: 5’</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour/level</p>
<p>This spell permits the caster to discover information about a magic item or a permanently enchanted area. For each turn spent studying the enchanted item or area, the caster may learn one feature of the enchantment. Features include spell effects, bonuses, and command words or activating conditions. The GM will choose the order in which the features are revealed, but command words or activating conditions should be last. Note that the number of charges remaining for a charged item is not revealed by this spell.</p>
<p>Each turn of study requires the caster to make a d20 roll, adding their Intelligence bonus and level. The total result must be 16 or higher to succeed; any failure ends the spell. A natural 1 is always a failure.</p>
<p>The item or area to be studied must be within 5’ of the caster for the full duration of scrutiny, and the caster must maintain moderate concentration.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="animal-friendship">Animal Friendship</h2>
<p>Druid 1</p>
<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>Upon encountering a normal or giant-sized (but not magical) animal, the druid may begin casting this spell, which requires an hour to complete. During this period the animal will remain nearby, and will not attack the caster or their allies for the duration of the casting (so long as they do not attack or otherwise disturb it). At the end of the casting, if the animal rolls a successful save vs.&nbsp;Spells, the spell has failed. At this point the animal acts naturally, without bearing the caster any special ill-will.</p>
<p>If the animal fails its save, it becomes an animal friend and joins the caster for the rest of its natural life, assisting in any way it can. Both the caster and any other animal friends are treated as treasured partners. There is no arcane mental connection, nor any particular control, but rather a strong fraternal bond, which should go both ways. If the animal is treated poorly, or it’s love not returned over a period of time, it could attempt another save vs.&nbsp;Spells at the GM’s discretion.</p>
<p>A caster may only have, at most, twice their level in hit dice of animal friends. If this spell is cast on an animal that would put the total above that number, it has no effect.</p>

<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.</p>

<p>This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e.&nbsp;300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).</p>
<p>The GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM’s discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10’, and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).</p>

<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell frees the caster’s spirit (or soul) from their body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.</p>
<p>The participants’ spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants’ original bodies in suspended animation.</p>
<p>This spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or the caster’s new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants’ spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="allSpells.html#gate">Gate</a>, the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, astral projection cannot be cast while still in the new body.

<p><strong>Bigby’s Forceful Hand</strong> is a more powerful version of <a href="allSpells.html#bigbys-interposing-hand">Bigby’s Interposing Hand</a>. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent.

<p>A creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blink">Blink</h2>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>By means of this spell, the wizard causes their material form to “blink” directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after the caster has blinked.</p>
<p>Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink–the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard’s initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from their previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<p>During each round that the caster blinks, they can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.</p>
<p>If the spellcaster holds off their attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to their normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, the caster probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get their attack in before the caster blinks (the caster must announce their intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative).</p>
<p>In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that their initiative roll is lower than their blink roll (the two rolls are not added if the caster is trying to attack before the caster blinks). If so, the caster attacks according to their initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If their blink roll is lower than their initiative roll, however, the caster blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction the caster’s facing (the caster must go through with their attack, even if the caster is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).</p>

<p>Range: 100’ + 10’/level</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>Immediately upon completion of the spell, and at most once per round thereafter, the caster may call down a 5 ft wide, 30 ft long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell’s range (measured from the caster’s position at the time of casting). Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs.&nbsp;Spells reduces damage taken by half.</p>
<p>The caster needs not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first the caster may choose to call a bolt instead of taking some other normal action. The caster may call a total number of bolts equal to one-third of their caster level, rounded down.</p>
<p>If the caster is outdoors and in a stormy area – a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental) – each bolt deals 3d8 points of damage instead of 3d6.</p>

<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A save vs.&nbsp;Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM’s discretion). The caster must speak the target’s language to communicate any commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster’s enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe” place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less.</p>

<p>This spell creates a 20’x20’x20’ cloud of poison gas which moves at a rate of 10’ per round under the control of the caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it).

<p>The caster speaks a single-word command, which will be obeyed by a single creature within the given range. The command must be given in a language the recipient understands. The recipient will do its best to obey, as long as the command is a clear, imperative verb. “Suicide” isn’t a verb. “Die” would cause the recipient to fake death for the duration of the spell (believing it was dead).

<p>Druid, Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Range: 240’</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only&nbsp;<a href="allSpells.html#dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="allSpells.html#dispel-evil">Dispel Evil</a>&nbsp;will banish the elemental once control has been lost.

<p>Cleric 3, Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Range: 360’</p>
<p>Duration: 1 year/level</p>
<p>This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30’ radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the&nbsp;<a href="allSpells.html#light">Light</a>&nbsp;spell, up to a maximum range of 360’ from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.</p>
<p>As with&nbsp;<a href="allSpells.html#light">Light</a>, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p>The reversed spell,&nbsp;<strong>Continual Darkness</strong>, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.</p>

<p>This spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time. Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used. If communication is not possible, they will still not attack. Intelligent undead creatures may save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled.

<p>Cleric 7, Druid 7</p>
<p>Range: 2 miles</p>
<p>Duration: 4d12 hours</p>
<p>The caster can change the weather in the local area. Any kind of weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area may be invoked. It takes 10 minutes for the weather to change to the desired conditions. For the duration of the spell, the caster may again change the conditions, but any such change will take another 10 minutes for the new conditions to arrive.</p>
<p>The caster has control over the general conditions of the weather, such as the direction and force of the winds, whether lightning is occurring, whether there is a tornado, and other directives. But, there is no specific control, so lightning cannot be forced to hit a particular spot and the path of a tornado cannot be dictated.</p>
<p>The spell allows the caster to remove conditions as well as bring them. (For example, an existing tornado can be replaced with calm weather.) At the end of the spell, the current conditions will continue, the caster just won’t be able to control them anymore.</p>

<p>Any corpse drained using this spell provides vigor to the caster and their active undead allies within range, healing 1d4 hit points per corpse, up to their maximum. Slain or destroyed undead do not heal or rise anew. Any corpses consumed by this spell cannot be raised or resurrected.</p>

<p>Duration: 1 hour/level</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to temporarily animate skeletons or zombies. A number of hit dice equal to the caster’s level may be animated for up to one hour per caster level. These non-permanent undead do not count towards the <a href="allSpells.html#re-animation">Re-animation</a> spell limitations, but they otherwise conform to the permanent undead created by that spell. Only one instance of this spell may be active at a time for any particular caster.</p>
<p>Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

Creatures of 8 or more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.</p>

<p>The caster alters wind force around them (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high). The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration. The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to 40 ft radius around them and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than their full limit.</p>
<p>The caster may choose wind patterns over the spell’s area. The caster can choose a downdraft blows from the center outward, an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.</p>
<p>For every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level.</p>

<p>Range: 60’</p>
<p>Cleric 1, Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.</p>
<p>The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.</p>
<p>Reversed, this spell becomes&nbsp;<strong>detect good</strong>, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.</p>

<p>The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.</p>

<p>The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any single target creature within range, to any spot within 200’ plus 20’ per caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An unwilling target may save vs.&nbsp;Spells to avoid being transported.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dispel-evil">Dispel Evil</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Cleric 5</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures from the nether planes, hereafter called “evil creatures.”</p>
<p>First, the caster’s Armor Class is improved by 4 points when attacked by evil creatures; this effect lasts until the spell ends, whether by expiration of the duration or through the employment of one of the following effects.</p>
<p>With a successful attack roll the caster can drive an evil creature back to the nether planes; the caster must of course be engaged with the creature (i.e.&nbsp;in melee range). The creature may make a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist. Any successful attack roll by the caster for this purpose ends the spells effects, whether or not the creature saves.</p>
<p>Alternately, by touching the affected creature, item, or area, the caster can immediately dispel any one spell or similar magical effect cast by the evil creature. There is no roll for this effect, except if the target is an unwilling creature in which case an attack roll is needed to actually touch it. The only spells which cannot be ended this way are those which are immune to <strong>dispel magic</strong>. Successfully performing the touch ends the spell, regardless of whether or not any evil magic is actually ended.</p>

<p>Range: 120’</p>
<p>Cleric 4, Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.</p>
<p>If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the&nbsp;<strong>dispel magic</strong>&nbsp;caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level caster dispelling magic created by a 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level caster has a 20% chance of failure.</p>

<p>This spell allows the caster to inflict a terrible curse on a living creature, reducing both Intelligence and Charisma to just 1 point each. A saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist this effect, but if the target creature is a spellcaster a penalty of -4 is applied to the saving throw.</p>
<p>Once feebleminded, the victim of this spell can no longer cast spells, speak or understand any language, or indeed communicate at all as their mind can no longer understand even such simple things as pointing or beckoning. The victim still knows their friends and allies and will follow them and try to help or protect them.</p>

<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Cleric 2</p>
<p>Duration: 3 turns</p>
<p>This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="find-the-path">Find the Path</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Cleric 6</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>This spell grants the caster, or another subject the caster touches, the ability to find the best and shortest route to a destination selected by the caster. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.</p>
<p>This spell works as well indoors or even underground as it does in the outdoors. However, <strong>find the path</strong> works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. It can only lead someone to a destination that is on the same plane of existence as the caster when cast; this can be very limiting if the caster (and subject if any) is in a closed or pocket universe of some kind.</p>
<p>The subject can sense the approximate direction of the destination, but also knows the best path to get there, sensing each turning and knowing which paths or corridors to follow when choices appear (but not sooner, unfortunately). The spell even overcomes things such as secret doors, which the subject will sense and know how to open, and grants the knowledge of passwords or codes at the correct moments.</p>
<p>Note that the spell will always choose the best path. For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible. If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own.</p>
<p>The spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first. If the duration expires before arrival, the subject may still remember the approximate direction to the destination but will no longer know the way.</p>

<p>Range: 100’+10’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Casting this spell causes a tiny glowing ember about the size of a pea to fly forth from the caster’s pointing finger, by which the direction of flight is indicated. The ember flies as fast as an arrow and explodes into flames filling a 20’ radius sphere when it reaches a distance chosen by the caster (up to its maximum range), or sooner if it impacts any solid or liquid surface. Those within the area of the flames suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells allowed for half damage.</p>
<p>No roll is normally required when casting this spell, but if the caster wishes to project the ember through a slit or other small opening they must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit it; failure indicates the fireball hits an adjacent surface and detonates there.</p>
<p>Combustible objects or substances within the area of effect will generally catch fire and possibly be destroyed (as determined by the GM). Metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the flames do not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).</p>
<p>While the fireball exerts little if any force or pressure when exploding, it may still destroy weak or flammable barriers; if such a thing happens (in the determination of the GM, of course), the fireball completes its expansion in the space beyond the destroyed barrier.</p>

<p>Range: 30’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell causes a living creature, along with all gear it wears or carries, to be petrified. This is the same effect caused by the gaze of a medusa or the touch of a cockatrice. A saving throw vs.&nbsp;Petrification is allowed to resist the spell.</p>
<p>The petrified victim becomes dormant; its mind cannot be contacted in any way, and it is neither properly alive nor dead. Damage inflicted on its statue-like form will apply to its fleshy form if it is ever restored; simply breaking off an arm or leg is probably enough to result in death due to blood loss. The GM should determine the effects of any such injury.</p>
<p>The reverse spell,&nbsp;<strong>stone to flesh</strong>, acts as a counterspell for&nbsp;<strong>flesh to stone</strong>, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not the result of&nbsp;<strong>flesh to stone</strong>&nbsp;or similar petrification effects (such as a medusa’s gaze).</p>

<p>Range: 0</p>
<p>Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Duration: 5 turns +1/level</p>
<p>The casting of this spell causes an invisible platform of magical force to appear. It is about the size of a shield, about 3 feet in diameter and an inch deep at its center. It can support a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster’s waist. It remains still when within 10’ of the caster, and follows at the caster’s movement rate if they move away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10 feet from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the surface beneath.</p>
<p>The disc must be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable.</p>

<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load.</p>
<p>If the spell duration expires while the subject is still airborne, the magic fails slowly such that the subject descends at a rate of 120 feet per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that time they land safely; if not, the subject falls the rest of the distance and suffers normal falling damage. However, if this spell is ended by <a href="allSpells.html#dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a> or similar outside forces, the subject falls immediately.

<p>Cleric 7, Magic-User 7</p>
<p>Range: 120’</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster’s location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.</p>
<p>The gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster’s choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility.</p>
<p>The gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell’s duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.</p>
<p>Note that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.</p>
<p>As long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e.&nbsp;wherever the GM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it.</p>

<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Range: 5’ per level</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p><strong>Gishigan’s Geas</strong> places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.</p>
<p>A saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.</p>
<p>The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.</p>
<p>If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the GM’s discretion.</p>
<p>For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.</p>
<p>A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a&nbsp;[Remove] Curse(allSpells.html#remove-curse)&nbsp;spell, or by a&nbsp;<strong>Wish</strong>, or by the reverse of this spell.&nbsp;<a href="allSpells.html#dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a>&nbsp;does not affect a geas.</p>

<p>This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal’s carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the GM’s discretion).</p>
<p>All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.</p>
<p>The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.</p>

<p>This spell causes normal vegetation of any sort within range to become thick and overgrown. The area of effect is determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1,000 square feet (a 10’x100’ area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants become densely entangled, and characters or creatures wishing to move through must hack or force their way through it. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate.</p>
<p>This spell cannot take effect in an area that does not already have some plants present. Any sort of animated plant creature affected by this spell is allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist, but if this save fails it is affected as with <strong>growth of animals</strong> above.</p>
<p>The reverse form, <strong>shrink plants</strong>, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version. Animated plant creatures are normally unaffected by this spell, but if such creatures have already been enlarged by <strong>growth of plants</strong> this spell will reverse the effect. In the latter case, a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist.</p>

<p>The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

<p>Range: 30’+10’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The affected creatures move and act twice as fast as normal, having double their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.</p>
<p>In combat, the subject of this spell performs a full round of actions (movement followed by attacking) on their normal Initiative; after all combatants have acted, the subject may perform another round of actions as before. If two or more combatants are under the effect of this spell, use the same Initiative numbers to determine the order of their actions in each of their “extra” rounds.</p>
<p>Reversed, haste becomes&nbsp;<strong>slow</strong>; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs.&nbsp;Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and slow counter and dispel each other.</p>

<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Cleric 6</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell enables the caster to almost totally cure wounds, diseases, and other afflictions of a single living creature. With a touch the caster cures blindness, deafness, <strong>confusion</strong>, disease, <strong>feeblemind</strong>, choking, nausea, and poison. All but 1d4 hit points are restored to the subject, if it has any injuries. Ability points losses are fully restored, if and only if those losses would be recoverable without this spell; permanent losses to ability scores are not recovered. Energy drain is also not affected by this spell.</p>
<p>The reversed spell,&nbsp;<strong>harm</strong>, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which&nbsp;<strong>harm</strong>&nbsp;may kill a creature).</p>
<p>Generally, both&nbsp;<strong>heal</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;harm</strong>&nbsp;only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell.</p>

The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes their save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.</p>
<p>A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. A character who has somehow gained wings and is then paralyzed while airborne will not be able to move its wings to fly and will thus fall.</p>

<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell secures a portal such as a door, gate, window, or shutter made of normal non-magical building materials; the portal behaves as if securely locked for the duration of the spell. The door may be opened early only by means of <strong>knock</strong> or a successful casting of <strong>dispel magic</strong>, or by literally destroying the door (which may well require more time than the duration of this spell allows).</p>

<p>Range: 300’+30’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>This spell causes a powerful storm of sleet and hail to fall in a 20’ radius around the target spot for a full round. This effect causes 5d6 points of damage to every creature within the area, with a save vs.&nbsp;Spells allowed to reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40’, so creatures higher than that distance above the target spot are unaffected. Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its save).</p>
<p>Visibility within the storm is very poor, such that most creatures will attack with a penalty of -2 on the attack roll. Walking movement is reduced to half speed, and running is not possible within the storm; anyone who tries will fall down and be forced to remain on the ground until the spell ends. Flying is likewise impossible, and any flying creature within the area will be driven to the ground. A penalty of -20% is applied to any Listen rolls made by those in the storm’s area.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the hail and ice deposited by the storm disappears as if it had never existed.</p>

<p>Range: 300’+30’/level</p>
<p>Cleric 5</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level. See&nbsp;<a href="./monstersAll.html#insect-swarm">Insect Swarm</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Monsters</strong>&nbsp;section for the effects of a swarm. As explained there, a normal swarm of insects occupies a contiguous area equal to three 10 foot cubes; all swarms summoned by this spell must be contiguous with each other such that they effectively form a single huge swarm, though the caster may stretch them out in a line, form them into a block, or indeed arrange them in some serpentine form if desired.</p>
<p>The summoned swarms persist for the duration above, or until they are slain, whichever comes first. The caster may summon them in areas where creatures are already located. Once summoned, the swarms are stationary until they disappear or are slain, and they attack any creatures who are within their area.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="invisibility">Invisibility</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell causes the creature touched (who may be the caster) to become invisible, undetectable by normal vision or Darkvision. Invisible creatures may be detected by those with non-visual sensory abilities.</p>
<p>All items worn or carried by the target when the spell is cast become invisible as well. If the target lays down an invisible item, it instantly becomes visible again; on the other hand, items picked up do not automatically become invisible. If the target places a visible item entirely inside its invisible clothing, backpack, pouch, or other container so that if the target were visible the item could not be seen, it will become invisible just as if it were held when the spell was cast.</p>
<p>Note that casting this spell upon another makes the target invisible to the caster as well as everyone else. A party of invisible characters will likely experience problems with running into or tripping over each other. The spell lasts at most 24 hours if not ended sooner. It ends instantly if the target attacks an opponent or casts any spell. Other actions do not normally end the spell. The target may end the spell at will.</p>
<p>Objects that shed light may be made invisible but the light itself will remain visible, and the source of that light (and the character carrying it) can thus be discovered. Rain, dust, paint, and any other visible substance thrown or applied to an invisible creature will also render it detectable.</p>

<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>The target of this spell becomes invisible just as with <strong>invisibility</strong>, but in addition all other creatures within 10 feet of the target at the time of casting (referred to as members of the group) also become invisible. Unlike with normal invisibility, all members can see each other and themselves normally.</p>
<p>If any member negates the effect by attacking or casting a spell, it becomes visible but all other members remain invisible. However, if the original subject takes an action that negates the invisibility, it ends for the entire group. If a member negates its own invisibility, that member will no longer be able to see the still-invisible group members. Moving further than 10 feet from the target also causes a group member to become visible; returning to the area does not reinstate the invisibility.</p>

<p>The caster summons an&nbsp;<strong>invisible stalker</strong>&nbsp;to do his or her bidding (see the&nbsp;<a href="./monstersAll.html#invisible-stalker">Monsters</a>&nbsp;section, below, for details). The spell persists until&nbsp;<strong>dispel evil</strong>&nbsp;is cast on the creature, it is slain, or the task is fulfilled.

<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked,&nbsp;<strong>held</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>wizard locked</strong>&nbsp;doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a&nbsp;<strong>wizard locked</strong>&nbsp;door, the spell does not remove the&nbsp;<strong>wizard lock</strong>&nbsp;but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and the like.</p>
<p>Each casting undoes a single method of securing the door or item, so that for example a door which is both locked and stuck can be unlocked but will still be stuck; a second casting of knock will open such a door.</p>

<section id="levitate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="levitate">Levitate</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>When this spell is cast, the caster or any one creature or object they touch begins to levitate. Levitation allows the caster to cause the subject to rise or fall at a rate of as much as 20 feet per round.</p>
<p>If a target creature is unwilling, the caster must roll a successful attack roll in order to touch the target, and even if this roll succeeds the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the magic. Likewise, if the target is an object being held by an unwilling creature, a similar attack roll and saving throw will be required. Unattended objects are automatically affected when touched.</p>
<p>The caster controls the levitating subject mentally. If the caster ceases to control the subject, it remains at its current altitude until the spell ends, at which point it falls.</p>
<p>Levitation does not provide any means of horizontal movement, but neither is the levitated subject fixed in place. It can be moved by pushing or by towing with a rope, for example. A creature being levitated can pull itself along a cliff face or across a ceiling, or pull itself with a rope fixed to a solid object. Movement of this sort is usually at half normal walking speed. The subject cannot, however, change its own altitude.</p>
<p>If a levitating creature attempts to attack with most weapons it will find that it is unstable. The first such attack is made at a penalty of -1 on the attack roll, and this penalty worsens by an additional -1 each round to a maximum penalty of -5. Should the creature refrain from making an attack for a full round, it is reduced to the -1 penalty level on the next round. This does not usually affect spellcasting while levitated, however.</p>

<p>Range: 120’</p>
<p>Cleric 1, Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Duration: 6 turns + 1/level</p>
<p>This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.</p>
<p>Reversed,&nbsp;<strong>light</strong>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<strong>darkness</strong>, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.</p>
<p>A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.</p>
<p>Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A&nbsp;<strong>light</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>darkness</strong>&nbsp;spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).</p>

<div id="Lightning Bolt" class="spell" data-tag="Lightning Bolt">
<section id="lightning-bolt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lightning-bolt">Lightning Bolt</h2>
<p>Range: 100’ + 10’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Casting this spell causes a bright thin spark about the thickness of a string to fly forth from the caster’s pointing finger, which indicates the direction. The spark stretches as fast as an arrow’s flight until it reaches the caster’s chosen distance (but not more than the range given above) or strikes a solid or liquid surface, at which point it explodes into a full-fledged bolt of lightning extending another 60 feet further. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5 feet wide, arcing and jumping, so that while it is not actually 5 feet wide, for game purposes it is treated as if it were.</p>
<p>Those within the area of the lightning bolt suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells allowed for half damage.</p>
<p>If a lightning bolt is targeted at a body of water it explodes at the point of impact, as described above, but within the water volume struck it expands like a fireball to a maximum radius of 20 feet instead of performing as it does in the air. If a lightning bolt is cast underwater it explodes in the same way, but at the tip of the caster’s outstretched finger.</p>
<p>The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can damage metals with a low melting point; metals such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the lightning does not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).</p>
<p>If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM’s option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.</p>

<p>Range: 360’</p>
<p>Cleric 3, Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell grants the caster knowledge of the location of an object. The caster must know the object well or be able to clearly imagine it. (Viewing an accurate drawing or painting will suffice for the latter option.) A general item can be located; if more than one such item is in range, the spell will lead the caster to the nearest one.</p>
<p>Unique or unusual items can only be located if the caster has first-hand knowledge (not merely through divination such as <strong>clairvoyance</strong> or a <strong>crystal ball</strong>). The spell cannot be used to locate creatures of any sort. A layer of lead or gold no thicker than foil surrounding the item will prevent it from being located.</p>

<p>Range: 20’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>Using this spell the caster lowers the level of the water in a river, a lake, or even the sea by up to 2 feet per caster level for the given duration, but to no less than 1 inch deep. The spell affects an area with radius of at most 10 feet per level centered on the caster’s chosen location (within the range given).</p>
<p>There will be a steep slope up to the surface of any area of un-lowered water that falls outside the spell’s radius. Ships which were already in the area of effect as well as any that dare to enter it will be unable to climb the slope and thus unable to leave the area (if not outright beached by the spell in the first place).</p>
<p>This spell has the effect of <strong>slow</strong> (the reverse of <strong>haste</strong>) when cast upon water elementals and other creatures formed from water; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. It cannot be cast upon any other kind of creatures.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="magic-jar">Magic Jar</h2>
<p>Range: 60’</p>
<p>Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to attempt to possess the body of another living creature. The caster begins by placing their spirit into a gem, jewel, or large crystal of some sort within the spell range, called the magic jar. The caster needs to know where the magic jar is located, but does not have to be able to see it. While the caster’s spirit is outside their body, that body appears to all intents and purposes to be dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.</p>
<p>Each round after entering the magic jar the caster’s spirit can attempt to take control of the body of a living creature within the spell range; the target is allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist. If the saving throw fails, the spirit of the target (now called the host) is trapped in the magic jar and the caster’s spirit takes possession of the host’s body. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by <strong>protection from evil</strong> or a similar ward.</p>
<p>If the attempt to possess a victim fails, the caster’s spirit remains in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. The caster may make an attempt to possess another target on the following round, if desired.</p>
<p>If on the other hand the possession attempt is successful, the caster may remain in control of the host’s body for as long as desired. The caster’s spirit may return to the magic jar at any time when it is within spell range, restoring the host’s spirit to its own body. The caster may not return to the same host’s body again for the remainder of the duration of this spell, but may attempt to possess it again on a subsequent casting.</p>
<p>Whenever the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, it may choose to return to its own body if it is within spell range. If the body is not in range, the caster’s spirit may become trapped if no vulnerable creatures are in range.</p>
<p>Whenever the caster’s spirit returns to their own body, the spell ends. There is a 50% chance that the magic jar will shatter when the spell ends (if the spell did not end because it was broken), becoming worthless and unusable.</p>
<p>When the caster’s spirit possesses a host, the caster has access to the physical abilities of the host’s body, including Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while still retaining their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The caster has access only to their own knowledge, class and level, attack bonus, saving throws, spell casting ability, and any other purely mental capabilities.</p>
<p>The caster does not gain access to supernatural or otherwise extraordinary powers of the host, and may not be able to perform physical actions that the caster has never done before (such as flying, if a winged body has been possessed). The caster does have access to the host’s sensory capabilities, such as Darkvision, the enhanced sense of smell of a dog, and so on</p>
<p>If the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by <strong>dispel magic</strong> or physical damage), the caster’s spirit will return to its own body if it is in spell range; if not, the caster’s spirit departs (i.e.&nbsp;the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.</p>
<p>If the caster’s spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil, and the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit returns to the jar and the host’s spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit is freed from the jar and also departs, and the host’s body dies.</p>
<p>If the host’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken while in spell range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. If the jar is broken while out of range of the host’s body, the host’s spirit departs, the caster’s spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. <strong>Dispel evil</strong> can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. A stranded caster may use another casting of this spell (with another magic jar, of course) to return to their own body, which of course kills the host’s body.</p>

<p>Magic-User 1</p>

<p>This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from the caster’s fingertip and strike its target, which must be at least partially visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.</p>
<p>For every three caster levels beyond 1<sup>st</sup>, an additional missile is fired – two at 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level, three at 7<sup>th</sup>, four at 10<sup>th</sup>, and the maximum of five missiles at 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level or higher.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="magic-mouth">Magic Mouth</h2>
<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell places a simple form of programmed illusion on a non-living object within range. When triggered, the spell causes the illusion of a mouth to appear on the object and a message to be said aloud. The enchantment can remain in place indefinitely, but is expended when triggered (i.e.&nbsp;the message is normally delivered only once).</p>
<p>The message recounted may be up to three words per caster level in length. The caster may insert pauses in the message, but the entire message must be delivered in a time period of no more than a turn. The voice of the spell can be made to speak at any volume attainable by a normal human. It will sound enough like the caster’s own voice to be recognized by a close associate of the caster, but not identical.</p>
<p>The illusionary mouth moves as if actually speaking the message being delivered, and remains visible during pauses. If placed on an artistic depiction of a creature with a mouth (such as a painting or statue), the spell can be made to appear to animate the mouth of the object.</p>
<p>This spell cannot be used to activate magic items which have command words, nor to activate any other magical effects.</p>
<p>The caster must choose the conditions under which this spell is triggered. The conditions may be as complicated or simple as desired, but must depend only on sight and hearing; the spell has no other sensory capabilities. The spell also has no particular intelligence, and can be fooled by disguises or illusions. The spell does have the capability to effectively see in normal darkness, but not in any sort of magical darkness, and it cannot detect invisible creatures nor see through doors, walls, or even opaque curtains. Likewise, stealth or magical silence are effective in preventing audible triggers. Finally, the spell cannot detect a character’s class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC.</p>
<p>Triggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell.</p>

<p>Range: 100’+10’/level</p>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour/level</p>
<p>With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120’ radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself among the affected creatures.</p>
<p>Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by&nbsp;<strong>dispel magic</strong>.</p>

<p>Range: 60’</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>This spell, sometimes incorrectly called <strong>ESP</strong>, permits the caster to hear (and possibly see, if the target visualizes anything) the surface thoughts of one or more living creatures within range. The caster must designate a direction or select a visible target, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear” the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way, though any creature already under the effect of this spell or any similar form of telepathy will instantly know and be able to sense the direction of the caster.</p>
<p>Rock more than 2 inches thick or even a very thin covering of lead or gold will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are mindless creatures and constructs such as golems.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mirror-image">Mirror Image</h2>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to create multiple illusory duplicates (called figments) which seem to swirl and move around and through each other as well as the caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is the real one. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created.</p>
<p>The figments mimic the caster’s actions, going through the motions of casting spells, drinking potions, levitating, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.</p>
<p>Any opponent who attacks or casts spells directly on the caster will always hit a figment instead. Attacking a figment destroys it, whether or not the attack roll is successful, as does any attack spell directed at one. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a <strong>fireball</strong>, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was</p>

<p>This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.</p>
<p>Reversed, this spell becomes&nbsp;<strong>poison</strong>. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die.

<p>Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;(20 feet at 12<sup>th</sup>, 30 feet deep at 15<sup>th</sup>, 40 feet deep at 18<sup>th</sup>). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration,&nbsp;<strong>dispel magic</strong>, or caster’s choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.</p>

<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell is used to make another spell of 6th or lower level permanent. Only arcane magic can be affected: Clerical, Druidic, and other spells of divine nature can not be made permanent. No spell with a permanent or instantaneous duration can be made permanent.</p>
<p>A permanency spell lasts until dispelled. When it is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Casting a permanency spell causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution. Lost Constitution is recovered using the <a href="combat.html#constitution-point-losses">Constitution Point Losses rules</a>.</p>
<p>No more than two spells can be made permanent on a single person, item or place. If a third <strong>Permanency</strong> spell is cast it automatically fails, and there is a 50% that each of the two other permanency spells fails too.</p>
<p>A <strong>Permanency</strong> spell is not necessary to make any magical item; using permanency to bind a spell to an object, person, or place is not the same as crafting a magic item.</p>

<p>Range: 180’</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: concentration</p>
<p>This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of 20’x20’x20’. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.</p>
<p>If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.</p>
<p>Attempting to animate more creatures than the caster’s level grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs.&nbsp;Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be granted by the GM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polymorph-other">Polymorph Other</h2>
<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike&nbsp;<strong>polymorph self</strong>, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.</p>
<p>The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form after one round.</p>
<p>Equipment worn or carried will be dropped if the new form is unable to wear or carry the items. If any such items would be constricting or physically harmful to the new form, the transformation slows and alters such that they are dropped without damage to the items nor harm to the target creature. If the GM determines that any items cannot be removed in this way, they must decide on the exact results.</p>
<p>Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polymorph-self">Polymorph Self</h2>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour/level</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to change into a different form of living creature. The form assumed may not have more hit dice than the caster has levels, nor be incorporeal or gaseous.</p>
<p>The caster assumes the physical nature of the assumed form while retaining their mental and spiritual characteristics. They gain the Armor Class and all physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon they could use the dragon’s normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon’s breath.</p>
<p>If the form assumed is capable of speaking and making appropriate gestures (as determined by the GM) the caster may use their own spells in the assumed form.</p>
<p>Equipment worn or carried will be dropped if the new form is unable to wear or carry the items. If any such item would be constricting or physically harmful to the new form, the transformation slows and alters such that the item is dropped without damage to the items nor harm to the target creature. If the GM decides that any such item cannot be removed in this way, the spell fails.</p>
<p>The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell before that point if they wish.</p>

<p>Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Duration: 24 hours</p>
<p>This spell creates a field impenetrable to most kinds of scrutiny. Those looking into the area from outside see only a dark, foggy mass. <a href="dungeonAdventures.html#darkvision">Darkvision</a> cannot penetrate it. Eavesdroppers do not perceive any sound, no matter how loud, emanating from the area. Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally. Anyone inside the affected area is immune to <a href="allSpells.html#esp">ESP</a> spells.</p>
<p>Divination spells like <a href="allSpells.html#magic-mirror">Magic Mirror</a>, <a href="allSpells.html#clairvoyance">Clairvoyance</a>, and <a href="allSpells.html#clairvaudiance">Clairaudience</a> cannot perceive anything within the area.</p>
<p>No speech is possible between those inside and those outside the sanctum. The spell does not prevent other means of communication, such as telepathic communication, or such as that between a Magic-User and a familiar.</p>
<p>Private sanctum does not stop creatures from moving into and out of the area.</p>

<div id="Projected Image" class="spell" data-tag="Projected Image">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="projected-image">Projected Image</h2>
<p>Range: 240’</p>
<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Duration: 6 turns</p>
<p>This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. This illusory projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech, which is projected from the caster to the illusory image as if by a form of <strong>ventriloquism</strong>). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster.</p>
<p>A line of sight between the caster and their illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Any effect or action that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can’t directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster’s actual position, not the illusory self’s position.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protection-from-evil">Protection from Evil*</h2>
<p>Cleric 1, Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>This spell protects the caster or a creature touched by the caster (the “subject”) from evil; specifically, the spell wards against summoned creatures, creatures with significantly evil intentions, and extraplanar creatures of evil nature. A magical barrier with a radius of just 1 foot is created around the subject. The barrier moves with the subject, and provides three specific forms of magical protection against attacks or other effects attempted by the affected creatures against the subject.</p>
<p>First, the subject receives a bonus of +2 to their Armor Class, and a similar bonus of +2 on all saving throws. Second, the barrier blocks all attempts to <strong>charm</strong> or otherwise control the subject, or to possess the subject (such as with <strong>magic jar</strong>). Such attempts simply fail during the duration of this spell. Note however that a creature who receives this protection after being possessed is not cured of the possession.</p>
<p>Third, any and all summoned creatures and extraplanar creatures of evil nature are unable to physically touch the subject. Attacks by such creatures using their natural weapons simply fail. This effect is canceled if the subject performs any form of physical attack (even with a ranged weapon) on any affected creature, but the other features of the spell continue in force.</p>
<p>Reversed, this spell becomes <strong>protection from good</strong>. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” ones.</p>

<p>Cleric 4, Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>This spell functions exactly as&nbsp;<strong>protection from evil</strong>, but with a 10’ radius rather than a 1’ radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.</p>
<p>Reversed, this spell becomes&nbsp;<strong>protection from good 10’ radius</strong>, and functions exactly as the reversed form of&nbsp;<strong>protection from evil</strong>, except that it covers a 10’ radius around the target rather than the normal 1’ radius.</p>

<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn/level</p>
<p>The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.</p>

<p>Cleric 1</p>
<p>Range: 10’</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>With this spell the caster makes contaminated food or water pure and safe to eat or drink. Poison is neutralized and spoilage is reversed by this spell. The spell does not protect against future decay, however, nor does it affect magic potions (including, unfortunately, <strong>Potions of Poison</strong>). Unholy water, if it exists in your campaign, is ruined by the casting of this spell. The spell affects about 2 pounds of food and/or drink per caster level; note that a quart of water or similar drink weighs just over 2 pounds.</p>

<section id="quest" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quest">Quest*</h2>
<p>Range: 5’/level</p>
<p>Cleric 5</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>By means of this spell the caster compels a living creature to perform some specific action or services, or alternately to avoid performing some action. The target creature must be able to hear and understand the caster, or it cannot be affected. This spell will automatically fail if used to compel a creature to engage in some obviously self-destructive action.</p>
<p>A saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service. Once subjected to this spell, the subject must obey the instructions given by the caster indefinitely, though if the quest is to perform some action the spell effectively ends when that action has been completed.</p>
<p>For every 24 hours that an affected creature chooses not to obey the quest (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers 3d6 points of damage. This damage is limited, in that it will not kill the target; if the damage is enough to do so, roll 1d4 for the number of hit points the affected creature retains (similar to the spell <strong>harm</strong>, the reverse of <strong>heal</strong>).</p>
<p>If the task assigned to the subject of this spell is open- ended or otherwise unable to be completed, the subject is still compelled to try to perform the task, but the spell will end in no more than one day per caster level.</p>
<p>Very clever creatures may be able to subvert the instructions given; the GM must decide on the results of any such attempts.</p>
<p>A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a <strong>remove curse</strong> spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. <strong>Dispel magic</strong> does not affect a quest spell.</p>

<div id="Raise Dead*" class="spell" data-tag="Raise Dead*">
<section id="raise-dead" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="raise-dead">Raise Dead*</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Cleric 5</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell restores life to a deceased humanoid (as defined in <strong>charm person</strong>). The caster can only raise a being that has not been dead for more days than the caster has levels. The spirit of the target of this spell must be willing to return. If the target’s spirit is trapped or contained in any way, the spell will fail. It will also fail if the target died of old age, as the body simply has no life left in it. Similarly, undead creatures are not affected by this spell as they can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense.</p>
<p>The body of the target must be adequately intact to support life, but all wounds no matter how major are healed. Body parts missing when the target is raised are still missing afterward. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone.</p>
<p>Creatures brought back from the dead always suffer some loss or penalty from the ordeal. Characters lose one level of ability permanently (i.e.&nbsp;it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). First level characters are reduced to Normal Man status; if the character was already a Normal Man they lose a point of Constitution. These losses are permanent, though of course the character may gain levels in the normal fashion. (Characters reduced to Normal Man status must gain 1,000 XP to return to 1st level).</p>
<p>Monstrous humanoids (orcs, goblins, and the like) lose one hit die, or are reduced to ½ hit dice if the monster has just one to start with. Such humanoids who already have ½ hit dice are reduced to a single hit point. These losses are generally permanent, though the GM may allow such creatures in service to a player character to recover by gaining 1,000 XP per hit die the creature would be returning to (so a lizard man who has been reduced to 1 hit die must earn 2,000 XP to return to its original 2 hit dice); treat such a creature as being a retainer for this purpose.</p>
<p>Upon being raised, the target has 1 hit point per level or hit die (using its current reduced figure, of course), with a minimum of 1 hit point. A character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, <strong>slay living</strong>, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a humanoid) unless a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 points of damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="read-languages">Read Languages</h2>
<p>Range: 0</p>
<p>Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:</p>
<p>In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per caster level.</p>
<p>In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.</p>
<p>In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.</p>
<p>This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see&nbsp;<strong>read magic</strong>, below, for the correct spell to use in such cases.</p>
<p>The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn’t otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature’s mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.</p>

<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>When cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text.

<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.</p>
<p>This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>By touching the body of a deceased humanoid (as defined in <strong>charm person</strong>), the caster brings them back in an entirely new body. The whole body is not needed; in fact, even the smallest fragment of body is sufficient, so long as that fragment was part of the body at the time of the target’s death.</p>
<p>The caster can only reincarnate a being that has not been dead for more than a week. The spirit of the target of this spell must be willing to return. If the target’s spirit is trapped or contained in any way, the spell will fail.</p>

<p>If “choice” is rolled for a player character being reincarnated, the player is allowed to choose the new form from among those on the table above. If an NPC is being reincarnated, the GM may choose or roll again.</p>
<p>When the spell is cast, a new body forms in a nearby location selected by the caster. The body forms over a period of 6 turns (i.e.&nbsp;an hour), first as a misty outline, then becoming more solid moment by moment until it takes its first breath and awakens. The new form is a young adult, unless the target was younger than that when they died, in which case the new body is the same age as the deceased body.</p>
<p>The target creature’s new body has obviously suffered none of the harm that may have befallen the old one, and is completely healthy (at least, to start with).</p>
<p>The target remembers their previous life, and retains the same class (if possible for the new form) as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The target loses one level (or hit die); this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical <strong>restoration</strong>. The target’s hit points should be rerolled completely, as this is an entirely new body. If the target was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction its new Constitution score is reduced by 2</p>
<p>Characters turned into non-character humanoids (such as an elf who returns as a kobold) will require adjudication by the GM; if the restored target is a player character, the GM is counseled to give as much leeway to the player as possible with the character’s new form. Conversely, non-character humanoids who return as characters will need all ability scores rolled; such characters will usually be fighters with a level equal to the target’s previous hit dice minus 1, or as Normal Men if the target’s previous hit dice were 1 or less.</p>
<p>Undead creatures are not affected by this spell; such creatures can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remove-curse">Remove Curse*</h2>
<p>Range: 30’</p>
<p>Cleric 3, Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell removes any and all ordinary curses afflicting a creature. It does not generally remove the curse from a magic item such as a sword or suit of armor, but a character afflicted by a cursed item of this type will be freed of it long enough to discard the item (a turn, at least).</p>
<p>Some special curses are more difficult to remove, and may require a caster of a certain minimum level. A very few curses created by godlike beings cannot be removed by this spell at all.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).</p></li>
<li><p>-4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.</p></li>
<li><p>Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a&nbsp;<strong>remove curse</strong>&nbsp;spell.</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous (2 turns)</p>
<p>This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.</p>
<p>The reverse of this spell,&nbsp;<strong>cause fear</strong>, causes one target creature within 120’ to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs.&nbsp;Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.</p>

<p>This spell makes the caster, or any living creature the caster touches, completely immune to normal cold. The spell also gives protection against magical or otherwise superior cold such as the breath of an Ice Dragon or the <strong>ice storm</strong> spell. Specifically, the spell gives the protected creature a bonus of +3 on all saving throws against such effects, and reduces any damage suffered by half (so that for example a successful save vs.&nbsp;the Ice Dragon’s breath would reduce damage to just one-fourth normal, and even if the saving throw fails the protected creature only takes half damage).</p>

<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Cleric 6</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the&nbsp;<a href="./combat.html#energy-drain">Encounter</a>&nbsp;section) for more details.</p>
<p>Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.</p>

<p>Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the caster. It negates&nbsp;<strong>magic missile</strong>&nbsp;attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster’s Armor Class by +3 vs.&nbsp;melee attacks and +6 vs.&nbsp;missile weapons.

<p>Cleric 2</p>
<p>Range: 360’</p>
<p>Duration: 2 rounds/level</p>
<p>This spell creates a spherical area with a 15 foot radius where no sound will pass. No one within the affected area can make nor hear any sound. Neither does sound issue from the affected area; those outside cannot hear those inside. This effect blocks verbal communication, of course, as well as spell casting.</p>
<p>This effect can be cast in a fixed area, upon an item (making it portable), or upon a creature. An unwilling target receives a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to negate.</p>
<p>This spell can be used to protect against any kind of attack or magic where the victims must be able to hear the attacker, for such attacks cannot pass into or out of the affected area</p>

<p>Range: 90’</p>
<p>Magic-User 1</p>
<p>Duration: 5 rounds/level</p>
<p>This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or a single 4 hit die creature, into a magical slumber. Creatures of 5 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30’ of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist.</p>
<p>Victims of this spell can always be hit if attacked. Injuring such a creature will cause it to awaken, and it may begin fighting back or defending itself on the very next round. Slapping or shaking such a creature will awaken it in 1d4 rounds, but normal noises will not.</p>
<p>Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.</p>
<p>When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally at the GM’s option.</p>

<p>This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear them. The caster may change which animal they are speaking with at will, once per round.

<p>This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single living monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear them. The caster may change which monster they are speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster.

<p>Range: 20’</p>
<p>Cleric 4</p>
<p>Duration: 1 turn</p>
<p>This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single plant (either normal plant or animate plant creature). The GM should remember that normal plants have a limited sense of their surroundings, and most never move from the place where they sprouted. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Plant creatures will tend to be slightly more intelligent, and a reaction roll should be used to determine how such creatures respond to the caster’s words.</p>

<p>Range: 10’</p>
<p>Cleric 3</p>
<p>Duration: 3 rounds/level</p>
<p>With this spell the caster causes the corpse of an intelligent creature to become animated and to answer the caster’s questions. It does not matter how long the corpse has been dead, but it must be essentially intact with at least a comple te mouth in order to answer questions. The corpse will answer at most one question per two caster levels, but if the duration expires any remaining questions are lost. The corpse only knows what it knew when it was alive; this includes the languages it knew in life. Thus, the caster must share a language with the deceased in order to get any questions answered at all.</p>
<p>The answers given are drawn from knowledge “imprinted” on the corpse during life; the caster does not in any case actually communicate with the spirit of the deceased creature. The corpse cannot retain any information given to it, and does not even remember any previous instances of communication via this spell.</p>
<p>The answers given may not be useful for various reasons. If the corpse knew the caster when it was alive, or if the caster is a member of a group the deceased disliked, it may choose to lie or mislead the caster. If the caster asks the corpse questions of a personal nature, or questions that indicate the caster may be working against whatever interests the corpse had in life, it will almost certainly seek to mislead the caster.</p>
<p>If the corpse has been roused by this spell within the last seven days, the spell will fail. Undead creatures (including the remains of defeated undead creatures) cannot be affected by this spell.</p>

<p>Cleric 2</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but&nbsp;<strong>dispel magic</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>disintegrate</strong>, or a&nbsp;<strong>rod of cancellation</strong>&nbsp;will dispel it.</p>

<p>This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the&nbsp;<strong>Monsters</strong>&nbsp;section for details on types of <a href="./monstersAll.html#snake-giant-rattlesnake">snakes</a>.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster.

<p>This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell.

<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Duration: 3 turns</p>
<p>This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone; the caster can move such things weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level at a rate of up to 20 feet per round. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to resist, whether it is the creature itself being affected or an object in its possession.</p>
<p>In order to use this power the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no further spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentionally or not), the power may be used again on the next round but the target of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.</p>

<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>The caster of this spell is instantly transported to another location up to 100 miles away per level of ability. The spell transports the caster only within their current plane of existence. Other creatures (passengers) and inanimate objects (cargo) may be transported along with the caster, up to a maximum of 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs.&nbsp;Spells will prevent items in a creature’s possession from being teleported.</p>
<p>The spell is directed by the mind of the caster, who must visualize the destination area; failure to visualize it properly can cause the spell to fail in a variety of ways, and destinations heavily saturated with magical energy (as defined by the Game Master) will cause the spell to fail automatically.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Knows Well</strong> applies when the caster has visited the destination frequently and/or spent a substantial amount of time there; generally, the caster should have spent at least 7 days (not necessarily in a row) at the destination within the last year to qualify for this category. Any place where the caster lived for more than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year in their life, also qualifies.</p>
<p><strong>Knows Somewhat</strong> applies when the caster has spent substantial time in the destination area, but not enough to qualify for Knows Well. Alternately, the caster may have made an in-depth study of the area, looking at accurate drawings, maps, and floorplans or spending hours listening to descriptions from one or more people who Know Well the destination.</p>
<p><strong>Saw Once</strong> applies when the caster has visited a place for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster has attempted the study required for the second definition of Knows Somewhat but has failed to acquire enough information (in the GM’s opinion).</p>
<p><strong>If the caster attempts to travel to a location that does not exist</strong>, or perhaps once existed but has been destroyed or otherwise changed so much that the caster would not recognize it, roll 2d20 instead d% for the result of the casting. In this case, if Success! is rolled the spell simply fails and no one is transported anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Success!</strong> means exactly what it says. The caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely exactly where the caster intended</p>
<p><strong>Fell Short</strong> indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely 1d8x10% of the way to the intended destination. Note that arriving “safely” does not mean that the destination is safe, but only the trip</p>
<p><strong>Wrong Place</strong> means that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended destination. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range, as decided by the GM. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster</strong> indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo have encountered dimensional turbulence and have crashed, becoming separated (if passengers and/or cargo accompanied the caster) and being injured in the process. Each creature including the caster suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then rolls again on the same column using 2d20 instead of d%. If another Disaster is rolled for any creature, apply another 1d12 points of damage and roll once more. Cargo objects are not normally damaged but the result must be rolled for each such item to determine where it has appeared; in this case, if Disaster is rolled the cargo item disappears forever.</p>

<p>Cleric 5</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.</p>
<p>True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a&nbsp;<strong>crystal ball</strong>&nbsp;or in conjunction with&nbsp;<strong>clairvoyance</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wall-of-fire">Wall of Fire</h2>
<p>Range: 180’</p>
<p>Cleric 5, Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/level (or special)</p>
<p>This spell creates a vertical sheet of flames in an area indicated by the caster, which is either a wall of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling). The entire wall must lie within the range given above. One or both sides of the wall may be hot, as determined by the caster at the time of casting. Once created, the wall cannot be moved or changed.</p>
<p>Any creature within 20 feet of a hot side of the wall will suffer 1d4 points of damage each round, or 2d4 points if within 10 feet. Damage is applied on the round the spell is cast and each round thereafter. Actually passing through the wall causes 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 per caster level, even if the side the character or creature entered from was not a hot side.</p>
<p>Undead creatures are particularly susceptible to this spell, and suffer twice the damage described above.</p>
<p>If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.</p>
<p>The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at their option</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wall-of-iron">Wall of Iron</h2>
<p>Range: 90’</p>
<p>Magic-User 6</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>Using this spell the caster creates an iron wall. The wall stands upright, and consists of up to one 10’x10’ square section, one inch thick, per caster level. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and must always be created in contact with the ground or floor beneath it. It is always a flat plate with no bends, but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any obstructing object very closely. The wall cannot otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature.</p>
<p>If the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any inanimate materials they touch (stone walls, soil, furnishings, and so on). If this is not done, the wall may be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on the situation) and will thus likely fall. If left unattended, there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in 1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction by any character having a minimum of Strength score of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice. Several creatures can work together to do so if desired. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.)</p>
<p>When the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely to be injured or killed. If it is possible for a character or creature to escape the area (i.e.&nbsp;it has sufficient movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). If this save is successful, the creature or character moves by the most direct route to the nearest safe space; if the save fails or it is for some reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are inflicted on that victim. Creatures larger than ogre-sized are immune to being crushed and will simply be knocked down if the save fails.</p>
<p>The wall is permanent, as indicated, but being made of iron is susceptible to rust and corrosion</p>

<p>Range: 15’ per level</p>
<p>Magic-User 5</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>Using this spell the caster creates a stone wall. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, one foot thick, per caster level. The caster can form this wall into almost any shape, with some restrictions. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall cannot be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature. It must be adequately supported by existing stone, which it will bond with automatically, but need not be supported over its entire area. For example, a wall of stone may be formed into a bridge over a stream or chasm, so long as both ends of the bridge rest solidly upon (and bond with) existing stone.</p>
<p>Bridges longer than 20 feet must be arched, buttressed, or both in order to stand; this extra construction reduces the wall’s usable volume by half, as does creating a wall with battlements, crenelations, and similar basic structural elements. No complex structural elements may be created by this spell.</p>
<p>Though made by magic, the wall is made of stone and can be broken or damaged just as if it were ordinary stone.</p>
<p>The wall can be formed into a container to trap creatures, and if this is attempted the targets of the spell are allowed to save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to avoid being trapped. If the save is successful the targets are able to make up to one full move to a space outside the container.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="water-breathing">Water Breathing</h2>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Magic-User 3</p>
<p>Duration: 2 hours/level</p>
<p>This spell grants living creatures touched by the caster (including the caster, if desired) the ability to breath in water as a fish does. The duration may be divided evenly if the caster touches multiple targets one after another. Affected targets do not lose the ability to breathe air.</p>

<div id="Web" class="spell" data-tag="Web">
<section id="web" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="web">Web</h2>
<p>Range: 10’ per level</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: 2 turns/level</p>
<p>This spell creates a volume of sticky strands resembling a spider’s web but much larger and thicker. The spell fills a volume of up to 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10’x10’x10’ cubes). The webs must be attached to adjacent solid objects such as walls, pillars, and the like; any unsupported section of webbing collapses to the ground and disappears. Within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs they wish, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if they wish.</p>
<p>Creatures within the web at the time the spell is cast, as well as anyone entering the area afterward, will become entangled. Each should roll a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray, and any creatures who succeed at this save may move through the webbing but are reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.</p>
<p>Those who fail the save are fully entangled and trapped. They cannot move, cast spells, or perform normal attacks or any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.</p>
<p>Attacks against an entangled creature by one outside the webbing will not normally entrap the attacker, so long as they do not need to venture into the web to reach the entangled target.</p>
<p>The web can be ignited; any application of fire to the webbing will cause a 10 foot cube to burn away in one round, with all 10 foot cubes adjacent to the destroyed one burning in the next round, and so on. If any part of the web becomes unsupported it will collapse and disappear as noted above.</p>
<p>Creatures trapped within the burning web suffer 2d4 points of damage when the cube they are trapped in burns, but they are thereafter completely free of the web.</p>

<div id="Wizard Eye" class="spell" data-tag="Wizard Eye">
<section id="wizard-eye" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wizard-eye">Wizard Eye</h2>
<p>Range: 240’</p>
<p>Magic-User 4</p>
<p>Duration: 6 turns</p>
<p>With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye” through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240’ away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40’ per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240’ feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human’s eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.</p>

<div id="Wizard Lock" class="spell" data-tag="Wizard Lock">
<section id="wizard-lock" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wizard-lock">Wizard Lock</h2>
<p>Range: 20’</p>
<p>Magic-User 2</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. The effect lasts indefinitely. <strong>Knock</strong> can be used to open the doorway without ending the spell, and <strong>dispel magic</strong> can be used to end it permanently. The caster of this spell can easily open the door or other portal without ending the spell, as can a Magic-User three or more levels higher than the caster.</p>

<div id="Word of Recall" class="spell" data-tag="Word of Recall">
<section id="word-of-recall" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-of-recall">Word of Recall</h2>
<p>Range: Self (special)</p>
<p>Cleric 6</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>With the utterance of a single word this spell transports the caster to a place of refuge which they designate when preparing the spell. The place must be Known Well (as explained for <strong>teleport</strong>) to the caster to be so designated. This spell cannot transport the caster beyond their current plane of existence.</p>
<p>The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).</p>
<p>Unwilling creatures cannot be transported by this spell, nor can items in their possession. If the caster or one of their passengers is holding an object that is also being held by an unwilling creature, the latter can retain possession of the object with a successful save vs. Spells.</p>
