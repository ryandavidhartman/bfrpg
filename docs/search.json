    "text": "What Is a Role-Playing Game?\nIn the almost 50 years since the first role-playing game appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard of one or two such games, and many have played. Still, some have not tried RPGs; if you are one of those people, this part is for you.\nRole-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly two to eight, and a Dungeon Master (DM), who is responsible for running the world, creating and managing the towns, nations, ruins, non-player characters (NPCs), monsters, treasure, and all other elements that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to determine the success or failure of actions in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral dice for this purpose.\nIn essence, role-playing games are grown-up games of pretend, with rules to determine outcomes. These rules range from very free-form and simple to very complex and detailed.\nThis game attempts to balance simplicity and complexity, being neither too detailed nor too free-form.",

For new GMs or those with limited preparation time, pre-written adventures (modules) are available for free on the basicfantasy.org website. Modules written for other game systems can also be used with some conversion.",

    "text": "How to Create a Player Character\nTo begin creating your player character, you’ll need a piece of paper to record their statistics. You can use a preprinted character sheet if available, or simply use a piece of notebook paper. An example character is shown below. It’s recommended to use a pencil for recording information, as any statistic may change during play.\nRoll 4d6 for each ability score. Reroll any 1s and discard the lowest die. Assign the results to each ability, described in the Character Abilities section, as desired.\nWrite down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next page.\nNext, choose a race and class for your character. Your character must meet the Prime Requisite minimum for a class, as described in the Character Classes section, to be a member of that class. Additionally, note that there are minimum (and maximum) ability requirements for the various races, which must be met, as described in the Character Races section.\nWrite down the special abilities of your race and class choices, as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask your Dungeon Master what spell or spells your character knows; it’s up to the Dungeon Master to decide this, but they may allow you to choose one or more spells yourself.\nNote on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP). Also, you may want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class.\nFirst-level characters begin play with the maximum HP for your class plus your Constitution bonus or penalty. Note the result as your hit points on your character sheet.\nRoll for your starting money. Generally, your character will start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Dungeon Master before rolling. Here is an interactive tool to roll your starting gold.\nNow, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the Equipment section. Write your purchases on your character sheet and note how much money remains afterward. Ensure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class and race before making your purchases. Here is an interactive tool to purchase equipment.\nSince you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don’t forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.\nLook up your character’s attack bonus (see Table 20.3 in Encounters) and note it on your character sheet. Don’t add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e., melee or missile weapon).\nAlso, look up your saving throws (from the tables near the end of the Encounter or at the appropriate class). Note them on your character sheet. Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if your character is a demi-human (see Character Races). Please note that the saving throw bonuses for demi-humans are presented as “plus” values, to be added to the die roll. For convenience, you may simply subtract them from the saving throw numbers on the character sheet instead.\nFinally, if you haven’t done so already, name your character. This often takes longer than all the other steps combined.",

    "text": "Ability Scores\nEach character will have a score ranging from 6 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has a Prime Requisite ability score, which must be at least 9 for the character to become a member of that class. Additionally, there are required minimum and maximum scores for each character race other than Humans, as described under Character Races.\nStrength: This ability measures the character’s raw physical power. Strength is the Prime Requisite for Fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack and damage rolls in melee (hand-to-hand) combat. Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point in any case (see the Combat section for details).\nIntelligence: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge. Intelligence is the Prime Requisite for Magic-Users, and they receive a Spell Bonus based on their Intelligence score. The ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of languages the character can learn to read and write. Characters with an Intelligence penalty may struggle with learning languages, being limited to understanding only their native language.\nWisdom: Wisdom is a combination of intuition, willpower, and common sense. It is the Prime Requisite for Clerics, who receive a Spell Bonus and a bonus to Turn Undead based on their Wisdom score. The Wisdom bonus or penalty may apply to some saving throws vs. magical attacks, particularly those affecting the target’s will.\nDexterity: This ability measures the character’s quickness, balance, and aptitude with tools. Dexterity is the Prime Requisite for Thieves. The Dexterity bonus or penalty applies to all attack rolls with missile (ranged) weapons, to the character’s Armor Class value, and to the character’s Initiative die roll.\nConstitution: Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each hit die rolled by the character. Note that a penalty here will not reduce any hit die roll to less than 1 point.\nCharisma: This ability represents the character’s ability to influence or lead people. Those with high Charisma are well-liked or highly respected. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to reaction rolls. Also, the number of retainers a character can hire and the loyalty of those retainers are affected by Charisma.",

They are short, stocky beings with beards, typically standing around four feet tall and weighing approximately 160 pounds. Their long hair and thick beards come in dark brown, gray, or black hues. They take great pride in their beards, often braiding or forking them. Dwarves tend to have dark, ruddy complexions.\nRenowned for their strength and hardiness, dwarves endure pain, fatigue, and suffering better than most other races, boasting a lifespan of three to four centuries. Despite their hardiness, they tend to appear old upon reaching maturity.\nDwarves are skilled in blacksmithing, gem cutting, and craftwork, particularly with materials like stone, gold, silver, and mithril. They are typically known for their practicality, stubbornness, and courage, though they can also be introspective, suspicious, and possessive. Dwarves have a fondness for beer and ale.\nMany Dwarven clans reside in Hammerfast, the Dwarvish Stronghold, including the Battlehammer, Stoutaxes, Strongfellow, and Rockbrow families.\nRestrictions: Dwarves may pursue careers as Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves. They must have a minimum Constitution score of 9. Due to their generally dour dispositions, they may not possess a Charisma score higher than 17. Additionally, dwarves are restricted from wielding Large weapons exceeding four feet in length, such as two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows.\nDwarves also incur a -10 feet penalty to combat movement.\nSpecial Abilities: All Dwarves possess Darkvision with a range of 60 feet and are adept at detecting slanting passages, traps, shifting walls, and new constructions, gaining a +1 bonus on Investigation Skill checks when examining and searching these features.\nSaving Throws: Dwarves gain a +4 bonus against Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, as well as a +3 bonus against Dragon Breath.",

It is said that the elves first arrived during the start of the Age of Dragons, having traveled East across the Far Away Sea. They settled in the Luisian Forest and built Imladris, the City of Elves. Elves are practically immortal, noble, and fair.\nElves are a slender race, with both genders standing around five feet tall and weighing around 130 pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body or facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful, with keen eyesight and hearing. They are typically inquisitive, passionate, self-assured, and sometimes haughty. Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or more. Elves do not sleep but instead enter trances for 4 hours a day in which they remain semiconscious.\nRestrictions: Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, Magic-Users, or Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the classes of Fighter and Magic-User, and of Magic-User and Thief (see Combination Classes). They are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9. Due to their generally delicate nature, they may not have a Constitution higher than 17. Elves never roll larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.\nSpecial Abilities: All Elves have Darkvision with a 60’ range. Elves are so observant that they have an additional +1 on Perception Skill and Spot Skills checks. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack of ghouls, as well as the Sleep spell. Elves are only surprised on a DC17 or better. Elves also receive +10 feet to combat movement.\nSaving Throws: Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify, and +2 vs. Magic Wands and Spells.",

They don’t really belong in either world, having to decide which community they identify with more. For this reason, they work excellently as ambassadors or wander off feeling excluded from all places, sometimes in search of adventurers with whom they can find a sense of belonging. An average Half-Elf male stands around 5’5” in height, with females averaging an inch shorter. They have pointed ears, but their features tend to favor the Human parent a bit more than the Elf. Half-elves live much longer than Humans, often exceeding 200 years.\nRestrictions: Half-Elves may become members of any class or combination allowed to Elves. They are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9, and like Elves, they may not have Constitution scores higher than 17. They do not suffer from the Elven hit dice limit.\nSpecial Abilities: Half-Elves have Darkvision with a 30’ range. They also have an additional +1 on Perception Skill checks.

However, a strong sense of curiosity inhabits many of them, leading some of these little folk to become adventurers or travel to other places. They are extremely agile, but due to their short legs, they are not as fast as other races. Halflings are good-natured, hospitable, and easygoing folk, three to four feet in height and weighing about 60 pounds. They have curly brown hair on their heads and feet, but rarely have facial hair. They are usually fair-skinned, often with ruddy cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for their small size. They are dexterous and nimble, capable of moving quietly and remaining very still. They usually go barefoot. Halflings have lifespans comparable to, but slightly longer than, humans. A halfling is typically considered an adult in their early twenties, and some live into their 150s.\nRestrictions: Halflings may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9. Due to their small stature, they may not have a Strength higher than 17. Halflings never roll larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit points regardless of class. Halflings may not use Large weapons and must wield Medium weapons with both hands.\nSpecial Abilities: Halflings are unusually accurate with all sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a +1 attack bonus when employing them. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, Halflings gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class. Halflings are quick-witted, thus adding +1 to Initiative die rolls. Halflings can hide in shadows indoors like the Thief ability and hide outdoors like the Ranger ability of the same level.\nSaving Throws: Halflings save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs. Dragon Breath.",

The Cleric brandishes their holy symbol and calls upon the power of their divine patron. The player rolls 1d20 and adds their Wisdom Bonus.\nIf the table indicates “No”, it is not possible for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20 to Turn. Areas indicating “T” indicate that this type of undead is automatically affected. If the result shown is a “D,” then the undead is destroyed rather than merely Turned.\nIf the roll is a success, 2d6 + Wis hit dice of undead monsters are affected. Surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected if the first roll succeeds.\nIf a mixed group of undead is to be Turned, the result is checked against the weakest first.\nIf a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead monsters present are affected, they may try again in the next round to turn any remaining undead. If any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose. Turned Undead monsters flee from the Cleric at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric or those near them for at least 2d4 turns.\nUndead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little fiery embers and ash. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as above.\nNote: Evil clerics can choose to command Undead rather than turn them.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.6: Turn Undead Table DC + Wisdom Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric Lvl\nSkeleton\nZombie\nGhoul\nWight\nWraith\nMummy\nSpectre\nVampire\nGhost\n\n\n\n\n\n1 HD\n2 HD\n3 HD\n4 HD\n5 HD\n6 HD\n7 HD\n8 HD\n9+ HD\n\n\n1\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n2\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n3\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n4\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n8\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\n\n\n10\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\n\n\n11\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\n\n\n12\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\n\n\n13\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\n\n\n14\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n\n\n15\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n\n\n16\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n\n\n17\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n\n\n18\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n\n\n19\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n\n\n20\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7",

They are a hybrid of Magic-User and Cleric, drawing power from nature and ley lines, and revering all the gods of OnceWas as well as elemental forces. Druids serve the natural order in a more direct way by working actively to restore balance. Often, a Druid uses mistletoe as a holy symbol, but this can vary with specific nature deities. Druids spend their time contemplating nature or in mundane forms of service such as ministering in rural areas. However, some are called to go abroad to serve the natural order more directly by working actively to restore balance.\nDruids advance at the same rate as Clerics but use the same combat and saving throw tables as Magic-Users. Druids can cast spells of divine nature starting at 2nd level, and they have the power of Animal Affinity (detailed at the end), working much like the Clerical ability to Turn Undead. They can identify any natural animal or plant and can identify clean water.\nThe Prime Requisite for Druid is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Druid. Druids may not utilize metal armor of any type, and they are likewise limited to wooden shields. Druids utilize any one-handed melee weapon, as well as staff, sling, and shortbow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: Druid XP Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Level\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nExp.

The Druid rolls a d20 and adds their Wisdom Bonus. Cross-reference the Druid’s level with the animal’s hit dice on the Druids Animal Affinity Table. The number shown is the minimum needed to Calm that sort of animal.  Tame, Domesticated, or Normal Beasts of Burden are treated as half their actual Hit Dice, reflecting their relatively easy manageability. Monstrous animals such as griffins, owlbears, pegasi, or other such “near-natural” creatures are treated as they are 1 HD more than listed to reflect their unique natures. \nIf the table indicates “No” then it is not possible for the Druid to affect that type of animal. If the table says “C” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically calmed. If the result shown is a “B” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically befriended. If the roll is a success, 2d6 HD of animals is affected. Surplus hit dice are lost, but at least one animal is always affected if the first roll is a success.  If a mixed group of animals is to be affected, the druid rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first and if they are successfully Calmed or Befriended, the same result is checked against the next higher type of animal.\nIf a Druid succeeds at Calming or Befriending some of the animals, but not all are affected, they may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Calm or Befriend the Animals fails, that Druid may not attempt to use their Animal Affinity ability again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.\nCalm animals will not interact with the Druid in any manner, unless approached by the Druid. The Druid can calmly get them to leave an area, or the Druid can try to befriend the animals. In this case, the DM should roll a reaction roll with any result below “uncertain” meaning the animals flee. If the result on the table results in automatically befriending the animals, the DM should treat the animals as if a “Friendly,” result was rolled on the Reaction Roll Table. A Befriended animal will follow the Druid, guarding and assisting within its capabilities so long as the Druid remains in the general vicinity of its normal lair or range. However, it will not fight to the death or sacrifice itself indiscriminately. When substantially wounded, an animal will flee the area immediately. The DM may check morale as necessary when the situation seems appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.11: Druid Animal Affinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Lvl\n&lt; 1 HD\n1 HD\n2 HD\n3 HD\n4 HD\n5 HD\n6 HD\n7 HD\n8 HD\n9 HD\n10 HD\n\n\n\n\n1\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n2\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n3\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n4\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n8\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n10\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\n\n\n11\nB\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\n\n\n12\nB\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\n\n\n13\nB\nB\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\n\n\n14\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\n\n\n15\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\n\n\n16\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n\n\n17\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n\n\n18\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11\n15\n\n\n19\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\n2\n5\n9\n13\n\n\n20\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\n3\n7\n11",

    "text": "Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic users are scarce. They are just as frequently reviled as they are revered, often experiencing the shifting tides of popularity as political dynamics ebb and flow.\n\nEveryone knows that magic exists, but it is not typical in people’s daily lives.\nIt is common among the working class to think that bad things tend to happen whenever magic is about.\nMagic items are uncommon — hidden away in deep dungeons or put on display as symbols of the owner’s power.\nInstitutions of magic are rare outside of Glantri.\nPlaces of interest, cities, religious sites, concentrations of monsters, and wizard towers are all usually built on ley lines or high points.\n\nMagic-Users seek and use knowledge of the arcane. They perform magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater power, but rather through insight and understanding. Every Magic-User has a spellbook containing the magical formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned. Spellbooks are written in the Arcane Language. All Magic-Users begin play knowing how to read, write, and speak Arcane.\nMagic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling behind.\nThe Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things interfere with spellcasting.\nA first-level Magic-User begins play knowing read magic and one other spell of first level. These spells are written in a spellbook provided by his or her master. The DM may roll for the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player to choose it, at his or her option.

The player can also choose one 0 Level Spell and one 1 level Spell. The DM rolls any additional 0 and 1 spells randomly.\n\n\nInherent Detect Magic\nMagic-Users can detect magic in anything they touch. Magical items or creatures feel warm, cause a tingling sensation, or have some other unusual tactile effect.\n\n\nInherent Read Magic\nMagic-Users can read and write magic (Arcane) without a spell. The arcane language was discovered by Magic-Users (not invented). Arcane language is the same no matter what the native language or culture of the spell caster.\n\n\nArcane Bolt\nThis is a bolt of raw magic. The target gets a save vs. spells to avoid all damage. The bolt has a range of 30 feet and does 1d4 damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures only affected by magical weapons. The Arcane Bolt does not affect inanimate objects.\n\n\nSpell Preparation\nA Magic-User may only prepare spells after resting and needs one turn per each three spell levels to do so. Spells prepared but not used on a previous day are not lost. For example, a 3rd level Magic-User preparing all three of their available spells (two 1st level and one 2nd level) is preparing a total of 4 levels of spells, and thus needs 2 turns (4 divided by 3 and rounded up). Each day, usually in the morning, spellcasters prepare spells by studying their spellbooks to replace those they have used. Spells prepared but not used persist from day to day; only those cast must be replaced. A spellcaster may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting it) to prepare a different spell of that level.\n\n\nCasting\nMagic-Users must have at least one hand free and be able to speak to cast spells. Binding and gagging a spellcaster is an effective means of preventing spell casting. In combat, casting a spell takes the same time as making an attack\n\n\nSpell Disruption\nIf a Magic-User is attacked (even if not hit), the character must make a saving throw vs. spells on the Initiative number on which they are casting a spell. On a failure, the spell is spoiled and lost. As a specific exception, two spell casters releasing their spells at each other on the same Initiative number will both succeed in their casting; one caster may disrupt another with a spell only if they have a better initiative and chooses to delay casting the spell until right before the other caster.\n\n\nLearning New Spells\nA Magic-User may learn spells by being taught directly by another magic user, by studying, by transcribing from a spell scroll or another individual’s spellbook, or through research. If being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day, while referencing another individual’s spellbook takes one day per spell level. It typically costs 300 gps per spell level.\nTo copy a spell, the character must spend 1d4 hours per Spell Level. The chance of successfully mastering a spell is DC 12 -1 per level of the magic-user, - INT bonus, +1 per level of the spell. Any failure requires another Magic-User who knows the spell to teach it. Spell mastery failure isn’t black and white. Spells that aren’t mastered may be cast but require a D20 check on the Potential Spell Failure Table.\n\n\n\nTable 5.27: Potential Spell Failure Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n1\nSpell fails entirely. A demon or other hostile entity appropriate to the setting appears and attacks the caster.\n\n\n2-4\nSpell fails entirely. Caster takes 1d6 points of injury.\n\n\n5-7\nSpell fails entirely. Caster temporarily forgets the spell. Make a DC10 Int roll after a week, and again each following week, until they remember.\n\n\n8-10\nSpell has the reverse of the intended effect.\n\n\n11-12\nSpell affects someone or something other than its intended target – friend, foe, or random object.\n\n\n13-14\nSpell produces nothing but a loud noise, bright flash of light, awful odor, etc.\n\n\n15-17\nSpell produces a weaker version of the intended effect.\n\n\n18-20\nSpell is cast normally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat School of Magic in Glantri\nThe Great School of Magic in Glantri City is a place of arcane learning and the heart of Glantrian society. While many magic-users have been privately tutored, the best and brightest come from the Great School. There are 4 two-month quarters at the school separated by month long breaks. One on one mentoring continues until the Magic-User is 4th level at which point they are released to independent study. Routine testing is still administered until 6th level at which time the Magic-User graduates and is formally declared a Magic-User. After that time, they may stay at the school to use the facilities and take Arcana courses, but this is usually frowned upon.\n\nGreat School of Magic Costs and Expenses\nThe tuition for the Great School is 300 gp per spell level. One week is required per spell level to complete the research. Tuition covers access to the facilities, mentor, classes, and common needs such as ink and paper. Thrown in for free are a small room and three (poor) meals a day for those who want it.\n\n\nArcane Symbols\nMagic-Users trained at Great School of Magic will be familar with the runes identifying potions created by the School’s Master Alchemist. Kappiyan Flurmastyr is the current Master Alchemist.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-Users will also recognize certain arcane symbols representing the four basic elements.",

Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the Magic-Users at higher levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief.

One Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities, though the DM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The DM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty. Also note that the DM may apply situational adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees fit; for instance, it’s obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the DM might apply a penalty of -1 for the slimy wall.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.31: Thief Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThief Level\nOpen Locks (+Dex)\nFind/ Remove Traps (+Int)\nPick Pockets (+Dex)\nMove Silently (+Dex)\nClimb Walls (+Str)\nHide in Shadows (+Int)\nListen/ Hear Noise (+Wis)\nDecipher Script (+Int)\nUse Arcane Scroll (+Int)\n\n\n\n\n1\n16\n17\n15\n16\n5\n18\n15\n19\nNo\n\n\n2\n15\n16\n14\n15\n5\n17\n14\n7\nNo\n\n\n3\n14\n15\n13\n14\n5\n16\n13\n6\nNo\n\n\n4\n13\n14\n12\n13\n4\n15\n13\n6\n10\n\n\n5\n12\n13\n11\n12\n4\n14\n12\n6\n9\n\n\n6\n11\n12\n10\n11\n4\n13\n11\n6\n8\n\n\n7\n10\n11\n9\n10\n4\n12\n10\n6\n7\n\n\n8\n9\n10\n8\n9\n4\n11\n9\n6\n6\n\n\n9\n8\n9\n7\n8\n3\n10\n9\n5\n5\n\n\n10\n8\n8\n6\n8\n3\n8\n8\n5\n4\n\n\n11\n7\n7\n6\n7\n3\n7\n8\n5\n4\n\n\n12\n7\n7\n5\n6\n3\n6\n7\n5\n4\n\n\n13\n6\n7\n4\n5\n3\n5\n6\n4\n4\n\n\n14\n5\n6\n3\n5\n3\n5\n6\n4\n4\n\n\n15\n4\n5\n3\n4\n3\n5\n5\n4\n4\n\n\n16\n4\n5\n2\n4\n2\n4\n5\n4\n4\n\n\n17\n4\n5\n2\n3\n2\n4\n4\n4\n3\n\n\n18\n3\n5\n2\n3\n2\n4\n3\n4\n3\n\n\n19\n3\n5\n2\n2\n1\n3\n3\n4\n2\n\n\n20\n3\n4\n2\n2\n1\n3\n2\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility Bonus or Penalty Adjustments\nEach Thief ability is governed by an ability score and affected by the ability score modifier.

It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails, the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of experience before trying again.\n\n\nFind/Remove Traps\nRemove Traps is generally rolled twice: first to detect the trap, and second to disarm it. The DM will make these rolls as the player won’t know for sure if the character is successful or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.\n\n\nPick Pockets\nPick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse, etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the roll is failed, the Thief didn’t get what he or she wanted; but further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the DM’s option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).\n\n\nMove Silently\nMove Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the DM. The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.\n\n\nClimb Walls\nClimb Walls permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The DM may require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100 feet. See Falling Damage.\n\n\nHide in Shadows\nHide permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always believes he or she is being successful, so the DM makes the roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.\n\n\nListen\nListen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The DM must decide what noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a noise could have been heard. The DM should always make this roll for the player. Note that the Thief and his or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.\n\n\nRead Language\nStarting at 2nd level, thieves have the special ability to decipher written text in a language that they do not speak. They can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language, or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. This includes intricate, exotic, or very old writing.\nIf the check succeeds, the character understands the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, another check should be made to see if the character avoids drawing a false conclusion about the text (success means that the character does not draw a false conclusion; failure means that the character does).\n\n\nUse Arcane Scroll\nStarting at 4th level, thieves have a chance to decipher magical writings and utilize arcane scrolls.\n\n\nSneak Attack\nFinally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn’t know the Thief is there. The DM may require a Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is successful. A Thief usually can’t make a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in any given combat.\nThe Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case subduing damage is done). Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the “flat of the blade;” the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in this case is subduing damage.\nAt 7th level, Thieves get triple Sneak Attack damage.\n\n\nThieve’s Cant or Thieve’s Tongue\nThieves’ Cant is a secret language used by thieves and other criminals to communicate without being understood by outsiders. It combines verbal expressions, hand signals, and sometimes written symbols",

Many class-kits are designed to emulate certain standard fantasy gaming concepts such as a Shadowblade is essentially a Figther with the Assassin class-kit. Or a Arcane Healer is a Magic-User with the Mystic Theurge class-kit. Other class-kits are altogether new character concepts that have not been represented in these sorts of games.\nOverall, the idea is to create a multitude of character concepts with just a few additional options added. If one uses just the four core classes, each added class-kit adds another four variations for character types, leading to many more combinations if some of the optional standard sub-classes are utilized as well. That all said, the Dungeon Master should not feel obligated to use every class-kit presented here, nor allow every conceivable combination.\n\nThe Class-Kit Mechanic\nAdding a class-kit works in a similar fashion to combination class characters or multi-class characters found in other game editions. One main difference is that the class-kit does not alter or expand the standard base-class features such as hit die, saves, or attacking bonus directly, except in certain situations that are detailed in the individual class-kit description.\nTypically, a class-kit is chosen when the character is created. The sum of experience points for both the base and class-kit is necessary to achieve the new character level in a manner just like combo-classes. While not generally recommended, a character might decide to take on a class-kit after adventuring for a time (and acquiring levels). In this case, it is suggested that the character must devote all earned experience toward the class-kit until the class-kit level matches the base-class level. After achieving that equilibrium, normal progression (at the combined XP requirement) resumes.\nWhile the Dungeon Master may make special individual exceptions, it is generally recommended that a class-kit cannot be added to a character that is already combination-classed, as the character must split their attention between two such professions. Likewise, it is not recommended that more than one class-kit be applied to a single character. However, it is permissible that a character might mix a particular sub-class (if such are available) with an appropriate class-kit. For instance, if the Dungeon Master utilizes Druids (clerical sub-class), the character might be allowed to become a Barbaric-Druid with the DM’s approval. Certain combinations may be inappropriate regardless. The DM is suggested to exercise care with non-standard combinations with an eye for overall balance or campaign consistency.\n\n\nMystic Theurge Kit\nA Magic-User may choose to add the Mystic Theurge Kit. The additional Experience Point requirements for Mystic Theurge are added to those of the Magic-User.\nMystic Theurges are Magic-Users who place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, Mystic Theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.\n\nRequirements\n\nFor a Wizard to qualify to become a mystic theurge, the character must have at least 1 skill point in Religion.\nMystic Theurges must tithe at least 5% of their earnings toward the church.\n\n\n\nXP Progression\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Mystic Theurge XP Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nAdditional Exp.

The spell level can’t exceed the maximum level of Cleric Spell outlined in the chart above.\n\n\nHoly Burst\nA Mystic Theurge may channel divine power in order to combat the forces of darkness. This Holy Burst causes damage equal to the Mystic Theurge level to any undead, affecting all such creatures within a 10-foot radius. The Mystic Theurge may use this power a number of times per day according to their level (see chart) plus their Charisma bonus. For instance, a Magic-User with 3 levels of Mystic Theurge with a 15 Charisma (+1 bonus) can produce a Holy Burst twice per day.\n\n\nLay on Hands\nA Mystic Theurge may lay hands and heal 2 points of damage plus Intelligence Bonus. The Mystic Theurge may use this power a number of times per day according to their level (see chart).\n\n\n\nNature Warden Kit\nA Ranger may choose to adopt the Nature Warden Kit, augmenting their skills and responsibilities. The additional Experience Point requirements for the Nature Warden are added to those of the Ranger.\nNature Wardens are devout followers of Ki, the goddess of nature and life, entrusted with safeguarding the delicate balance of the natural world. They embody a harmonious blend of martial prowess and primal magic, drawing strength and wisdom from their deep connection to wild places and Ki.\nThrough disciplined study and communion with natural forces, Nature Wardens channel energies to protect forests, mountains, and rivers from harm. Their combat skills are complemented by an innate understanding of the land’s rhythms and its inhabitants, making them formidable adversaries to those who threaten nature’s balance.\n\nRequirements\nTo qualify as a Nature Warden, a Ranger must have at least 1 skill point in Religion (Ki) and be at least 6th level. Additionally, Nature Wardens must tithe at least 5% of their earnings to a Temple of Ki.\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\n\nDruid Spells\nNature Warden’s are able to cast a certain Druid spells per day as shown on the chart below.\n\n\nNature’s Insight\nThe Nature Warden possesses a natural affinity for the environment, allowing them to: - Identify any natural animal or plant with ease. - Determine the cleanliness of water sources by sensing purity or contamination.\nThese abilities stem from their deep connection to nature and enhance their skills in survival, herbalism, and environmental protection.\n\n\nNature’s Bond\nAt 2nd level as a Nature Warden, choose a type of terrain (such as Forest, Mountains, Swamp, etc.). The Nature Warden gains an additional +1 Initiative bonus when interacting in this terrain. This bonus reflects their heightened awareness and familiarity with the nuances of their chosen natural habitat.\n\n\nLimited Animal Affinity\nNature Wardens have a special bond with animals, allowing them to calm or befriend them to a limited extent. When encountering animals, the Nature Warden can attempt to calm or befriend them based on their level and the animals’ hit dice, as detailed in the Animal Affinity Table. This ability reinforces their role as protectors and stewards of the natural world, fostering cooperation with wildlife when needed.\n\n\n\nXP Progression\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Nature Warden XP Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Level\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nAdditional Exp.

Monstrous Animals or other “Near-Natural” Animals are treated as 1 Hit Die higher.\nThe DM looks up the Nature Warden’s level on the Nature Wardens Animal Affinity Table, below, and cross-references it with the animal’s hit dice. Tame or normally domesticated animals such as livestock, family pets, or normal beasts of burden are treated as half their actual HD, reflecting their relative easy manageability. Monstrous animals such as griffins, owlbears, pegasi, or other such “near-natural” creatures are treated as they are 1 HD more than listed to reflect their unique natures. If the table indicates “No” for that combination, it is not possible for the Nature Warden to affect that type of animal. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on the 1d20 to Calm that sort of animal. If the table says “C” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically affected. If the result shown is a “B” for that combination, that type of animal is automatically befriended.\nIf the roll is a success, 2d6 HD of animals are affected. Surplus hit dice are lost, but at least one animal is always affected if the first roll is a success.\nIf a mixed group of animals (say, a boar and a black bear) is to be affected, the player still rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the boar), and if they are successfully Calmed or Befriended, the same result is checked against the next higher type of animal. Likewise, the 2d6 HD are rolled only once. For example, if the group described above is to be affected by a 2nd level Nature Warden, he or she would first need to have rolled a 15 or higher to Calm the boar. If this is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 6, this would Calm the boar and leave a remainder of 4 HD of effect. Black bears are in fact 4 HD animals, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the black bear is Calmed as well. Obviously, were it a group of 2 boars and a black bear, the 2d6 roll would have to be a total of 8 or higher to affect them all.\nIf a Nature Warden succeeds at Calming or Befriending the animals, but not all animals present are affected, he or she may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Calm or Befriend the Animals fails, that Nature Warden may not attempt to use his or her Animal Affinity ability again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.\nCalm animals will not interact with the Nature Warden (or others accompanying the Nature Warden) in any manner, unless approached by the Nature Warden. The Nature Warden can calmly get them to leave an area, or the Nature Warden can try to befriend the animals. In this case, the DM should roll a reaction roll with any result below favorable meaning the animals flee. If the result on the table results in automatically befriending the animals, the DM should treat the animals as if a “Very Favorable” result was rolled on the Reaction Roll Table.\nA Befriended animal will follow the Nature Warden, guarding and assisting within its capabilities so long as the Nature Warden remains in the general vicinity of its normal lair or range. However, it will not “fight to the death” or sacrifice itself indiscriminately. When substantially wounded, an animal will flee the area immediately. Check morale as necessary when the situation seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nUmbral Harbinger Kit\n\nBackground\nThe Umbral Harbinger is a secretive sect of clerics who specialize in the clandestine arts of assassination, blending their divine magic with lethal precision. They serve dark or death-oriented deities, viewing themselves as instruments of divine justice or agents of necessary darkness in a troubled world.\nTheir actions are guided by a belief that darkness serves as a necessary counterbalance to the light, ensuring that justice, as their deity defines it, is served.\n\n\nRequirements\nTo qualify as an Umbral Harbinger, a Cleric must be at least 6th level and meet the following criteria:\n\nAlignment: Neutral or evil alignments.\nSkills: Must have at least 1 skill point in Poison.\nDeity: Must worship a dark deity.\nSociety of Whispers Assignments: Umbral Harbingers must occasionally undertake missions assigned by the Society of Whispers, a clandestine organization that deals in information gathering, espionage, and covert operations. These missions could involve infiltration, assassination, gathering intelligence, or eliminating threats to the Society’s interests. The Society of Whispers provides resources, information, and support to Umbral Harbingers in exchange for their services, forging a secretive alliance that strengthens both parties in the shadowy realm of intrigue and deception.\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\n\nSneak Attack\nUmbral Harbingers can perform a Sneak Attack whenever they are behind an opponent in melee, and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn’t know they are there. A successful Move Silently or Hide roll may determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and inflicts double damage if successful. An Umbral Harbinger cannot perform a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in the same combat encounter.\nThe Sneak Attack can be executed with any melee weapon or bare-handed (inflicting subduing damage). It can also be performed with the “flat of the blade,” where bonuses and penalties cancel out, resulting in a +0 attack bonus that deals normal damage (subduing damage in this case). At 7th level, Umbral Harbingers gain triple damage with their Sneak Attack.\n\n\nPoison\nUmbral Harbingers are proficient in the creation and application of lethal poisons, enhancing their capabilities in covert operations and assassination.\n\n\nAssassinate\nThis is the Umbral Harbinger’s primary special ability. Like the Sneak Attack, an Assassinate attempt can be made whenever the Umbral Harbinger is behind an opponent in melee and undetected. The attack must be made with a one-handed piercing weapon, such as a dagger or sword.\nThe attack is rolled with a +4 attack bonus. If the attack hits, the victim must make a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be instantly killed. A successful saving throw reduces the effect to normal weapon damage.\n\n\nWaylay\nUmbral Harbingers can attempt to render an opponent unconscious with a single strike, known as Waylay. This is executed in a manner like Assassinate, but using a weapon that normally inflicts subduing damage (e.g., club or cudgel). The attack is rolled with a +4 attack bonus. If successful, the victim must make a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be knocked unconscious. Creatures knocked unconscious by Waylay remain in that state for 2d8 turns if not awakened, suffering normal subduing damage in the process.\n\n\n\nXP Progression\n\n\n\nTable 6.4: Umbral Harbinger XP Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nAdditional Exp.

If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick.\nPush an Animal\nTo push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn’t know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded, the Target Number increases by 2 levels. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.\nTeach an Animal a Trick\nYou can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check. An animal can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.\n\nAttack: The animal attacks apparent enemies.\nCome: The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.\nDefend: The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given.

    "text": "Spot – Wis\nThe Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures that are hiding. Typically, a Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn’t intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.\n\nSpot Check Penalty\nCondition | Penalty -1 | Per 10 feet of distance -5 | Spotter distracted\nSpot checks can also be used to read lips. To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, a character must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see them speaking, and understand the speaker’s language. The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. A character must maintain a line of sight to the lips being read. If the Spot check succeeds, a character can understand the general content of a minute’s worth of speaking, but they miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, a character can’t read the speaker’s lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, they draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that a character doesn’t know whether they succeeded or missed by 5.",

Some items may be lashed to the outside, and thus count toward the weight limit but not the volume limit. A Halfling’s backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but costs the same as a full-sized item.\nA Candle will shed light over a 5’ radius, with dim light extending 5’ further. A normal candle will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.\nChalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin.\nHoly Water is explained in the Encounter section.\nIron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.\nA Lantern will provide light covering a 30’ radius; dim light will extend about 20’ further. A lantern will consume a flask of oil in 18+1d6 turns. A Hooded Lantern allows the light to be hidden or revealed as the user pleases; in all other ways it performs as an ordinary lantern. A Bullseye Lantern projects a cone of light 30’ long and 30’ wide at the widest point, with dim light extending an additional 20’ beyond that point. This type of lantern is generally hooded.\nA Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items. The case will have a water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or bandolier. A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.\nA Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons; for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without being turned to stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using reflected sunlight.\nA Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is the same for all types.\nDry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit, nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad” in less than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.\nHemp Rope is ½ inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally one-quarter of the breaking strength. One or more knots in a rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not affect the safe working load, because knots are figured into the listed one-quarter ratio.\nSilk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less than hemp rope. The notes regarding rope strength given for hemp rope, above, apply here also.\nA Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds or 4 cubic feet of goods.\nA Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds or 2 cubic feet of goods.\nA pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds or 1 cubic foot of goods (divided evenly between both bags).\nThieves’ Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief abilities such as opening locks and removing traps. These abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may be used at a penalty at the option of the Dungeon Master .\nA Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder, hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a dried piece of prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time required to start a fire should be determined by the DM according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions, starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a turn.\nA Torch sheds light over a 30’ radius, with dim light extending about 20’ further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns. Of course, a torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as cobwebs or oil) alight.\nA Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such as swords, daggers, and axes.\nWineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine; though generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness environment. The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid, which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a single day. If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount. Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty skin has negligible weight.",

    "section": "Poisons",
    "text": "Poisons\n\n\nBasic Poison\nThe first poison must Poisoners learn and easily produced by shadier folks. This poison is the bread and butter for assassins just starting out.\nThis is a contact poison in a thick, reddish liquid form. It somewhat smells like cucumbers.\nCost: 25 gp per dose\nComponent: Poisonous Plants\nEffect: On a hit, the target takes 1d4 poison damage. Save versus Poison negates.\nPotency: The poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.\n\n\nOleander\nOleander is a beautiful plant known for its striking flowers. Though commonly grown as a hedge and ornamental, all parts of the oleander plant are deadly and contain toxins. If eaten, oleander can cause vomiting, diarrhea, erratic pulse, seizures, coma, and death, and contact with the leaves and sap is known to be a skin irritant to some people. Indeed, the toxins in oleander are so strong that people have become ill after eating honey made by bees that visited the flowers! Fortunately, fatalities from oleander poisoning are rare, as the plant is very bitter and thus quickly deters anyone sampling the vegetation.\nCost: 25 gp per dose\nComponent: Poisonous Plants\nEffect: If ingested, the target takes 1d2 poison damage and is poisoned for 1d12 hours. A poisoned creature has -1 on Attack rolls, Saving Throws and Ability Checks.

Save versus poison or be paralyzed for 4d4 hours.\nPotency: The poison retains potency in food or drink for 2d4 days.\n\n\nWhite Snakeroot\nWhite snakeroot is an herb with flat-topped clusters of small white flowers. Simply drinking the milk of a cow that had grazed on the plant has poisoned some victims. Indeed, both the meat and milk from poisoned livestock can pass the toxin to human consumers. Symptoms of “milk poisoning” include loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, reddened tongue, abnormal acidity of the blood, and death. Luckily farmers are now aware of this life-threatening hazard and make efforts remove the plant from animal pastures.\nCost: 25 gp per dose\nComponent: Poisonous Plants\nEffect: If ingested, the target takes 1d4 poison damage and is poisoned for 2d12 hours. A poisoned creature has -1 on Attack rolls, Saving Throws and Ability Checks.

This is the best tool to get a target away from a group and allow them to finish the job.\nThis is an ingested Poison in a clear liquid form. It faintly smells like copper.\nCost: 75 gp per dose\nComponent: Giant Scorpion Venom\nEffect: When ingested, the target takes 1d12 poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours.

At the end of their turn they can repeat the saving throw, ending the paralyzed and poisoned condition on a success.\nDuration: Target is Poisoned and Paralyzed until they save.\nPotency: This poison stays potent for 10 minutes when applied to a weapon.\n\n\nEssence of Ether\nBreathing in this vapor subjects a creatures to its effect. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a poison saving throw with a -1 penalty or become unconscious.\nThis poison is a pleasant-smelling colorless inhaled vapor.\nCost: 250 gps\nComponent: This is a mysterious Alchemist concoction\nEffect: The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature awakens if they take damage or if another creature spends an action to awaken them.\nDuration: 8 hours\nPotency: Dissipates in 1d4 rounds\n\n\nMalice\nMalice is a white, odorless, bitter crystalline powder that is blown into the eyes or inhaled by the victim.\nCost: 300 gps per dose\nComponent:\nEffect: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Poison saving throw or become blinded for 1 hour.\nDuration: 1 hour.\nPotency: Dissipates immediately.\n\n\nPale Tincture\nThis strange substance is harvested from fungi cultivated by Myconids in their lairs under ground.

After three successful saves, the poison ends.\nDuration: Target must make three successful saves.\nPotency: Dissipates immediately.\n\n\nDrow Sleep Poison\nThis poison is said to be made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight.

    "text": "Notes Regarding Vehicles\nThe Crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors and/or rowers needed to operate the ship. Officers are not counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any casualties will not slow down the ship.\nCargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given in tons. If the ship sails night and day, each passenger requires living space equivalent to one ton of cargo; in addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy 1/10 of a ton of space.\nMovement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see Time and Scale for an explanation) as well as miles per day. The encounter movement of ships is not directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat, and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.\nThe parenthesized figure represents maneuverability; see Maneuverability in Part 5: The Encounter for details.\nSee Attacking a Vehicle, also in the Encounter section, for details on the Hardness and HP statistics.\nA chariot requires a single horse, generally a warhorse, to pull it. Both coaches and wagons require at least a pair of draft horses to pull them.\nA caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or three masts. Though superficially similar to the larger carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for which the larger ship is ill suited.\nA carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or four masts.\nGalleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed. A small galley will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers). Galleys are generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.\nThe longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar to the large galley. However, where more civilized nations have specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship is more generalized; most crewmen will be qualified for all of these tasks.",

    "text": "Siege Engines\nThese are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes ships. Their cost may be up to twice as high in a remote location. A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista, onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties, detailed below. Note: siege engines are not generally usable against individuals or monsters; the DM may make exceptions for very large monsters like giants or dragons. Review the rules in the Stronghold section for details regarding attacking fortified buildings such as castles, towers, fortresses, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeapon\nCost\nRate of Fire\nAttack Penalty\nDamage\nShort Range (+1)\nMedium Range (+0)\nLong Range (-2)\n\n\n\n\nBallista\n100 gp\n1/4\n-3\n2d8\n50’\n100’\n150’\n\n\nBattering Ram\n200 gp\n1/3\n+0\n2d8\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nOnager\n300 gp\n1/6\n-6\n2d12\n100’\n200’\n300’\n\n\nScrew\n200 gp\nN/A\nN/A\n1d8\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nSow\n100 gp\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nTrebuchet\n400 gp\n1/10\n-8\n3d10\nN/A\n300’\n400’\n\n\n\n\nBallista: This is effectively a very large crossbow that may fire a spear-like bolt or a large stone. It is usually mounted on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship. When firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone. A ballista requires a crew of three to operate.\nBattering Ram: These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of portable roof). They require a crew of eight or more.\nOnager: This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat trajectory. An onager requires a crew of four to operate.\nScrew: This device may be used to attack a stronghold, by means of boring through the walls. A crew of at least eight is required to operate it. It is only used at the base of a wall, and it is usually operated under a sow.\nSow: This is a kind of portable roof, used for protection while performing slower attacks on a fortified building. Those under a sow will be harder to hit, receiving at least a +6 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks while taking cover under it. The sow itself has a hardness of 9 and 50 hit points.\nTrebuchet: This mighty weapon uses a counterweight to fling a stone on a high, arcing path. It cannot fire at targets within 200 yards. If it is aimed at a target that is more than 20’ higher than the weapon, there is an additional –2 attack penalty. A trebuchet requires a crew of eight to operate.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The number of spells of each level which a Cleric or Magic-User may cast per day is shown on the appropriate table in the Classes section. Each day, usually in the morning, spellcasters prepare spells to replace those they have used. Clerics do this through prayer, while Magic-Users must study their spellbooks. Spells prepared but not used persist from day to day; only those actually cast must be replaced. A spellcaster may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting it) in order to prepare a different spell of that level.\nSpellcasters must have at least one hand free, and be able to speak, in order to cast spells; thus, binding and gagging a spellcaster is an effective means of preventing him or her from casting spells. In combat, casting a spell usually takes the same time as making an attack. If a spellcaster is attacked (even if not hit) or must make a saving throw (whether successful or not) on the Initiative number on which he or she is casting a spell, the spell is spoiled and lost. As a specific exception, two spell casters releasing their spells at each other on the same Initiative number will both succeed in their casting; one caster may disrupt another with a spell only if he or she has a better Initiative, and chooses to delay casting the spell until right before the other caster.\nSome spells are reversible; such spells are shown with an asterisk after the name.\n\nCleric Spells\nClerics receive their spells through faith and prayer. Each day, generally in the morning, a Cleric must pray for at least three turns in order to prepare spells. Of course, the Cleric may be expected to pray more than this in order to remain in his or her deity’s good graces.\nBecause they gain their spells through prayer, a Cleric may prepare any spell of any level he or she is able to cast. However, in some cases the Cleric’s deity may limit the availability of certain spells; for instance, a deity devoted to healing may refuse to grant reversed healing spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0, Clerical (Orisons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Minor Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster heals 1 hit points of damage by laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.\nThe reverse form of this spell, Cause Minor Wounds, causes 1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case.\nUndead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by Cure Minor Wounds and healed by Cause Minor Wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowse\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: Self\nDuration: Contcentration\nThis minor magical effect allows the caster to sense the presence of potable water using a forked stick (any will do, but some have favorites). While outdoors the dowsing rod will twist to point in the direction of such fresh water up to 1000 feet +100’ per level of the caster. Water that is underground, in containers, or within structures can be located within 25 feet +5’ per level. The effect lasts as long as the caster maintains concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidance*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe cleric grants +1 to any subject’s next attack roll. Reversed, this becomes Misguide, which gives the subject -1 to their next attack roll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallow*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy chanting holy phrases, the caster makes the 0 foot radius area around him ‘hallowed’, granting +1 bonus on Healing spells and Turning attempts. The effect continues as long as the caster maintains the chant, but any action other than moving and defending oneself ends the effect. However, the effect lasts one additional round after the chant ends, giving the caster the option to cast or turn once and enjoy the effect himself.\nThe reverse, Unhallow, works in the same manner by granting +1 damage on Inflict spells (reversed healing) makes undead (or vile netherworld inhabitants) harder to Turn by one point (or optionally easier to Command by one point). It likewise lasts one round longer than the chant is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeal Blessing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instaneous\nThe cleric says this short prayer before a meal to give the diners a blessing. Anyone who eats the meal within twenty minutes heals 1 hit point. The meal must be normally prepared and obtained in a way that the deity permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMend\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nMends breaks, dents, and holes in small objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredict Weather\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: General surroundings\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster may accurately predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtue\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round\nA subject gains one temporary hit point for ten minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nGrants +1 to the subject’s next saving throw. Reversed, this becomes Curse, which gives the opposite effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater to Wine*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe cleric may turn one flask or mug of water to wine. The reverse Wine to Water turns a flask of wine to pure water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round\nThe caster speaks a single-word command, which will be obeyed by a single creature within the given range. The command must be given in a language the recipient understands. The recipient will do its best to obey, as long as the command is a clear, imperative verb. “Suicide” isn’t a verb. “Die” would cause the recipient to fake death for the duration of the spell (believing it was dead). Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, fly, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc.\nUndead are not affected. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 or more and creatures with 6 or more hit dice may save vs. Spells to resist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Light Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.\nThe reverse form of this spell, Cause Light Wounds, causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case.\nUndead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by Cure Light Wounds and healed by Cause Light Wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 2\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the DM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes Detect Good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 2 turns\nThe caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Poison\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: 1’\nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level\nThis spell enables the priest to determine if an object has been poisoned or is poisonous. One object, or one 5-foot cubic mass, can be checked per round. The priest has a 5% chance per level of determining the exact type of poison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe Disruption spell blesses one blunt melee weapon, be it a mace, hammer, staff, with divine power. When fighting undead creatures or beings of the netherworld (demons, devils, and the like) the weapon is enhanced by +1 to hit and damage. This is in addition to any existing powers for an enchanted weapon.\nAny being subject to this bonus that is struck in combat must save versus Magic or be turned, exactly like the cleric ability (see Turning in the core rules), causing the affected monster to flee the area. The character wielding the blessed weapon may opt to not cause the disruption effect, but must declare their intention before their attack roll. The caster can have only one weapon blessed in this manner at a time.\nThe reverse of this spell Corruption works exactly the same against creatures of goodness from various heavenly realms. Only those worshiping vile powers would have access to the reversed version of this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 6 turns + 1/level\nThis spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.\nReversed, Light becomes Darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.\nA light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.\nEither version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A Light or Darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is left to the individual DM to decide.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a Magic Jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the Protection From Evil effect. If the Protection From Evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\nReversed, this spell becomes Protection From Good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurify Food and Water\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Fear*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: Touch (120’)\nDuration: Instantaneous (2 turns)\nThis spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.\nThe reverse of this spell, Cause Fear, causes one target creature within 120’ to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanctuary\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: Self\nDuration: 2 round + 1 round/level\nThis spell causes opponents to ignore the caster. Any opponent who might otherwise wish to attack or harm the caster must make a successful saving throw vs. Spells in order to do so; if this save fails, that opponent will behave as if the caster is not important and move on to whatever activity it would normally do if the caster were not present.\nThis spell does not prevent area effect attacks (fireball, ice storm, etc.) from harming the caster. While under protection from the spell, the caster is unable to perform any offensive acts, but may take any other action desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBless*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: 50’ radius\nDuration: 1 minute/level\nThis spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50’ radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical Fear.\nThe reverse of Bless is called Bane. It fills the caster’s enemies (within a 50’ radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected creature to suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls, morale checks, and saving throws against magical Fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Animal\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Level+1d4 rounds\nThis spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the same fashion as Charm Person, at a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the DM) are allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will resume normal activity immediately.\nThis spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animals; if combined with Speak With Animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Traps\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 3 turns\nThis spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about its type or nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGentle Repose\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 3 months/level\nThis spell preserves the remains of a dead creature (including a zombie, if so desired). This prevents any decay of the remains for the duration of the spell. This extends the time limit imposed by raise dead, allowing for a longer time to cast the spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat Metal*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 25’\nDuration: 7 rounds\nThis spell causes a single item made of ferrous (iron-based) metal to become hot for a brief period of time. The affected item is warm to the touch immediately, and then becomes progressively hotter each round as indicated on the table below. The damage roll indicated is applied to any creature holding or wearing the affected item; a brief touch does no damage.\nNote that this spell can damage items harmed by heat, such as potions for example, and might boil water, wine, or oil stored in vessels within affected metal item, possibly causing an affected vessel to burst. Generally this will happen on the 4th or 5th round, when the effect is at its most powerful.\n\n\n\nRound\nTemperature\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n1st\nWarm\nNone\n\n\n2nd-3rd\nHot\n1d4\n\n\n4th-5th\nSearing\n2d4\n\n\n6th\nHot\n1d4\n\n\n7th\nWarm\nNone\n\n\n\nThe reverse of this spell is Chill Metal. It inflicts damage as outlined in the table above, but the damage is caused by cold instead of heat. Note that this can freeze water, congeal oil, and so on. Frozen water might burst its vessel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Person\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Magic-User 3\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.\nA winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Paralysis\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell permits the caster to free the creature touched from paralysis induced either by magical means or by monster attack (e.g. venom or ghouls).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Cold\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a Fireball), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestore Health\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell removes unnatural weakness, mental or physical debilitation or exhaustion from the touched individual. This spell is useful for restoring temporary ability score draining, such as the strength-draining touch of a shadow. The caster chooses which ability score the spell will restore when casting. It has no effect on permanent ability score loss or energy drain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilence 15’ Radius\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 2 rounds/level\nUpon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15’ radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Special\nDuration: 1 turn/4 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpiritual Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but Dispel Magic, Disintegrate, or a Rod of Cancellation will dispel it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinual Light*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 year/level\nThis spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30’ radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the Light spell, up to a maximum range of 360’ from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.\nAs with Light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.\nThe reversed spell, Continual Darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Blindness*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including Light or Continual Light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes Cause Blindness, which causes a living creature touched to become blind. A successful melee attack roll is required to touch the victim, and no Saving Throw is allowed. Blinded creatures suffer the penalties described in Deafness and Blindness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Deafness*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering deafneass (whether caused by injury or by magic, including Cause Deafness). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes Cause Deafness, which causes a living creature touched to become deaf. A successful melee attack roll is required to touch the victim, and no Saving Throw is allowed. Deafened creatures suffer the penalties described in Deafness and Blindness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Disease*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nCure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.\nNote: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.\nThe reverse spell Cause Disease infects the target creature with a debilitating disease, causing it to suffer from symptoms such as fever, weakness, or nausea. The affected creature must make a saving throw to resist the disease’s effects. On a failed save, the creature suffers ongoing damage and penalties to its abilities until the disease is cured. The exact effects of the disease and the duration of its affliction can vary depending on the caster’s level and the discretion of the Dungeon Master .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3\nRange: 60’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal’s carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the DM’s discretion).\nAll equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.\nThe spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate Object\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as Clairvoyance or a Crystal Ball). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Curse*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nRemove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.\nThe reverse of this spell, Bestow Curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:\n–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).\n–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.\nEach round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.\nThe caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a Remove Curse spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSacrifice*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the cleric to transfer any desired number of hit points from himself to the target. The reverse of this spell, Drain Life, allows the caster to drain 1d6+1 hp from a creature, with a successful attack roll. The hit points are transferred to the cleric through healing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 3 rounds/level\nThis spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.\nIf the corpse has been subject to Speak with Dead within the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.\nThis spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.\nThis spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStriking\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTongues\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell allows the creature touched to speak and understand any language or dialect. Only one language can be spoken at a time, but any number can be understood. This spell does not alter other creatures’ dispositions and does not allow the affected creature to speak to creatures that cannot understand language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Breathing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThe affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nThis spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Water\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Serious Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell works exactly like Cure Light Wounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, Cause Serious Wounds, also works exactly like Cause Light Wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.\nIf dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the Dispel Magic caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.\nSome spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by Bestow Curse (the reverse of Remove Curse) as well as by cursed items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivination\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis magic and an offering (such as tea leaves) puts the caster in contact with the pattern of the universe. This pattern can be deciphered to interpret dreams, predict the future, Identify a Magic Item, or to find hidden things.\nThe caster may ask a single question. The DM roles on the chart below and gives tan appropriate reply based on that role. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\n\n\n(1d20)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1-3 (15%)\nTotal Failure; no answer\n\n\n4-6 (15%)\nPartial Failure; Misleading answer\n\n\n7-13 (35%)\nPartial Success; Cryptic answer\n\n\n14-17 (20%)\nSuccess; Clear but Succinct answer\n\n\n18-20 (15%)\nComplete Success; Clear and Detailed answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nTurns a reflective surface within range into a magic mirror through which the caster can view other creatures. The caster must know and name the creature. The caster and any other creatures viewing the mirror will be able to see the images, but only the caster will hear sound from the viewing. Detection and vision spells can be cast into it with a 3% chance per caster level of success. If successful, this allows the caster to cast detect magic, see invisible, etc. through the mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralize Poison*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.\nReversed, this spell becomes Poison. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster’s touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Evil 10’ Radius*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions exactly as Protection From Evil, but with a 10’ radius rather than a 1’ radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.\nReversed, this spell becomes Protection From Good 10’ Radius, and functions exactly as the reversed form of Protection From Evil, except that it covers a 10’ radius around the target rather than the normal 1’ radius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: 20’\nDuration: 1 turn\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform “services” other than to answer questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSticks to Snakes\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStone Shape\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to shape, bend, and form an existing piece of stone (of up to 10 cubic ft + 1 cubic ft per level) into any shape the caster wishes.\nFine detail is not possible but primitive doors, walls, bridges, or similar items can be created with this spell. Stone shaped in the form of moving or mechanical parts will not work on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommune\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or completely. These details are left to the DM’s discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Food\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Permanent\nThe food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster’s choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting Purify Food and Water on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Evil\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures from the nether planes, hereafter called “evil creatures.”\nFirst, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against attacks by evil creatures.\nSecond, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll). The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs. Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell, even if the saving throw succeeds.\nThird, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic also can’t be dispelled by Dispel Evil. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use also ends the spell.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the DM to decide; however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should almost always qualify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsect Plague\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: 300’+30’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlane Shift\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWhen cast, the caster or the creature touched is sent to another plane. If multiple creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight may plane shift. All participants must be willing. If any intended participant is unwilling, the spell fails with no effect. Plane shift is highly inaccurate and while the desired plane or dimension will always be reached, arrival will be 1-100 (d100) miles from the intended destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuest*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: 5’/level\nDuration: Special\nQuest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.\nA saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.\nThe affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.\nIf the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.\nIf the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.\nA quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a Remove Curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel Magic does not affect a Quest spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaise Dead*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.\nAlso note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.\nA raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.\nA creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.\nThe reverse of this spell, Slay Living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human, demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing of Lesser Healing*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: 15’ radius\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell Cure Light Wounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This spell thus cures 1d6+1 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.\nThe reverse of this spell, Ring of Lesser Infliction, allows the caster to cast Cause Light Wounds on multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This form of the spell causes 1d6+1 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Seeing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.\nTrue seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a Crystal ball or in conjunction with Clairvoyance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 1 round/level (or special)\nAn immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster’s turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.\nThe wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).\nIf the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 15’/level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, 1’ thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\nThe caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape the caster desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Objects\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).\nThe DM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the DM’s discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10’, and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the DM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade Barrier\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6\nRange: 90’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20’ long per caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5’ per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft. high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to half.\nIf the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful save vs. Death Ray.\nA blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against attacks made through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Undead\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Black Magic-User 6\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 6 round/level\nThis spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time. Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used. If communication is not possible, they will still not attack. Intelligent undead creatures may save vs. Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled. Unintelligent undead do not get a saving throw and the control is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the caster’s total control limit Re-animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Path\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.\nThe locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting.\nThe spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeal*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nHeal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue, Feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all but 1d4 of the target’s hit points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.\nThe reversed spell, Harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which Harm may kill a creature).\nGenerally, both Heal and Harm only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerate\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.\nThis spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoration*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nEach casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the Healing section) for more details.\nAlternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.\nRestoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for the spell Raise Dead).\nThe reverse, Energy Drain, draws away one life energy level like a wight. The energy drain requires the victim to be touched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Monsters\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Special\nDuration: 1 turn/5 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndeath to Death\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Magic-user (Black) 6\nRange: 240’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell destroys 3d12 hit dice or levels of undead creatures in a 30’ radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each undead creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save are immediately destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of Recall\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Self (special)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWord of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).\nAn unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 7, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Magic Shell\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7, Magic-user 6\nRange: 10’ Radius\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nWithin a 10’ radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstral Projection\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Magic-user 7\nRange: Self\nDuration: Special\nThis spell frees the caster’s spirit (or soul) from their body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.\nThe participants’ spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants’ original bodies in suspended animation.\nThis spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or the caster’s new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants’ spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.\nUnlike Gate, the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, astral projection cannot be cast while still in the new body. To go to a different plane, the caster must end the spell, bringing everyone back to their original bodies and cast a new spell from their original bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Weather\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 2 miles\nDuration: 4d12 hours\nThe caster can change the weather in the local area. Any kind of weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area may be invoked. It takes 10 minutes for the weather to change to the desired conditions. For the duration of the spell, the caster may again change the conditions, but any such change will take another 10 minutes for the new conditions to arrive.\nThe caster has control over the general conditions of the weather, such as the direction and force of the winds, whether lightning is occurring, whether there is a tornado, and other directives. But, there is no specific control, so lightning cannot be forced to hit a particular spot and the path of a tornado cannot be dictated.\nThe spell allows the caster to remove conditions as well as bring them. (For example, an existing tornado can be replaced with calm weather.) At the end of the spell, the current conditions will continue, the caster just won’t be able to control them anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthquake\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 400’ + 40’/level\nDuration: 1 round\nWhen cast, this spell causes a powerful, but localized, earthquake that is 10 feet in diameter per caster level. The shock of the quake will knock down creatures, topple plants, collapse structures, open cracks in the earth, and more. The effect lasts for one round, during which creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area. The specific effect depends on the type of terrain where the spell is cast:\n• Cave, cavern, tunnel: Causes the roof to collapse causing 8d6 damage to everyone in the affected area (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble. Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.\n• Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.\n• Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures in the area have a 1 in 4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.\n• Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring hardness. If this causes the structure to collapse, anyone trapped inside takes 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.\n• River, lake, marsh: Fissures in the bottom drain the water away, resulting in a muddy quicksand-like surface to remain. All creatures in the affected area must save vs. Death Ray or be stuck. After the end of the spell, the surrounding water rushes back in, potentially drowning any creatures stuck in the mud.\nAny creature pinned by rubble takes 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per minute until rescued or they fall unconscious. Once unconscious, they take 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until they are rescued or die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell causes an area 20’x10’x10’ per caster level to be filled with holy fire. The caster can determine the shape of the area, but the entire area must be contiguous. Any creature in the designated area takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any immunity or resistance to fire. Any creature that dies from the damage (or was already dead when the fire storm is cast) is completely consumed by the fire. The fire only harms creatures and does not affect the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Magic-User 7\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster’s location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.\nThe gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster’s choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility.\nThe gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell’s duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.\nNote that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.\nAs long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the DM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly Word\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell represents the single most powerful word of any cleric’s purest faith. When uttered, the cleric pulses with a blinding radiance and all enemies of the cleric within a 30’ radius that can hear the caster suffer 2d8 points of damage per level of the cleric. Because of the searing light emanating from him, each enemy within range that can see the cleric must make a save vs. Spells or be blinded. Creatures struck dead by this spell burst into fierce flames and burn down to a fine ash within a single round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResurrection\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell restores life to a deceased creature. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than ten years per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nThis spell operates similarly to raise dead, but is more powerful. The full body is not required; only a small portion is required, but that portion must have been part of the subject’s body at the time of death. (The dust left from a disintegrate spell counts as the required small portion.) A whole new body is created, so it will be at the peak of health, with full hit points, and all spells prepared at the time of death.\nThis is still an ordeal, however. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is resurrected, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.\nA creature which has become undead can be resurrected as long as the undead creature has been destroyed. Constructs and elementals cannot be resurrected.\nThe spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing of Greater Healing*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 15’ radius\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell Cure Serious Wounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This spell thus cures 3d6+3 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.\nThe reverse of this spell, Ring of Greater Infliction, allows the caster to cast Cause Serious Wounds on multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This form of the spell causes 3d6+3 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Walk\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell alters the substance of the caster’s body to a cloud-like vapor (as the Gaseous Form spell) and the caster can move through the air, potentially at great speed. Other creatures can be touched by the caster, which causes them to be affected by the spell, too, each of whom acts independently. Up to one additional person per three caster levels my be included in the spell.\nWhile under the spell, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet, able to move any direction at any time. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round, but maneuverability becomes very poor. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.\nFor the duration of the spell, each participant may freely switch between its physical form and its vaporous form as desired, but each change takes five rounds. The caster can dismiss the spell at any time, either individually or for everyone at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Spells\nDruids will bring their magic into being by tapping into the innate magic of the natural world, the Elemental Planes and the gods of OnceWas. Each day, generally in the morning, a druid must meditate for at least three turns to prepare spells. A Druid may prepare any spell of any level they are able to cast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0, Druid (Orisons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Minor Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster heals 1 hit points of damage by laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.\nThe reverse form of this spell, Cause Minor Wounds, causes 1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case.\nUndead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by Cure Minor Wounds and healed by Cause Minor Wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowse\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: Self\nDuration: Contcentration\nThis minor magical effect allows the caster to sense the presence of potable water using a forked stick (any will do, but some have favorites). While outdoors the dowsing rod will twist to point in the direction of such fresh water up to 1000 feet +100’ per level of the caster. Water that is underground, in containers, or within structures can be located within 25 feet +5’ per level. The effect lasts as long as the caster maintains concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidance*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe druid grants +1 to any subject’s next attack roll. Reversed, this becomes Misguide, which gives the subject -1 to their next attack roll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallow*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy chanting holy phrases, the caster makes the 0 foot radius area around him ‘hallowed’, granting +1 bonus on Healing spells and Turning attempts. The effect continues as long as the caster maintains the chant, but any action other than moving and defending oneself ends the effect. However, the effect lasts one additional round after the chant ends, giving the caster the option to cast or turn once and enjoy the effect himself.\nThe reverse, Unhallow, works in the same manner by granting +1 damage on Inflict spells (reversed healing) makes undead (or vile netherworld inhabitants) harder to Turn by one point (or optionally easier to Command by one point). It likewise lasts one round longer than the chant is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeal Blessing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instaneous\nThe cleric says this short prayer before a meal to give the diners a blessing. Anyone who eats the meal within twenty minutes heals 1 hit point. The meal must be normally prepared and obtained in a way that the deity permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMend\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nMends breaks, dents, and holes in small objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredict Weather\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: General surroundings\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster may accurately predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Vermin*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0, Cleric 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis cantrip summons one small, totally ordinary insect (such as a beetle, fly, or spider), a small rodent (such as a field mouse), or a cloud of gnats into a certain area. If targeted intelligently, the spell may be able to disrupt spellcasting, but will never deal any actual damage (including poison) to the target. Reversed, this cantrip becomes Exterminate, which may kill any one creature of similar size as the ones described in the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtue\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round\nA subject gains one temporary hit point for ten minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nGrants +1 to the subject’s next saving throw. Reversed, this becomes Curse, which gives the opposite effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater to Wine*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 0, Druid 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe cleric may turn one flask or mug of water to wine. The reverse Wine to Water turns a flask of wine to pure water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Friendship\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Permanent\nUpon encountering a normal or giant-sized (but not magical) animal, the druid may begin casting this spell, which requires an hour to complete. During this period the animal will remain nearby, and will not attack the caster or their allies for the duration of the casting (so long as they do not attack or otherwise disturb it). At the end of the casting, if the animal rolls a successful save vs. Spells, the spell has failed. At this point the animal acts naturally, without bearing the caster any special ill-will.\nIf the animal fails its save, it becomes an animal friend and joins the caster for the rest of its natural life, assisting in any way it can. Both the caster and any other animal friends are treated as treasured partners. There is no arcane mental connection, nor any particular control, but rather a strong fraternal bond, which should go both ways. If the animal is treated poorly, or it’s love not returned over a period of time, it could attempt another save vs. Spells at the DM’s discretion.\nA caster may only have, at most, twice their level in hit dice of animal friends. If this spell is cast on an animal that would put the total above that number, it has no effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Water\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Light Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.\nThe reverse form of this spell, Cause Light Wounds, causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case.\nUndead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by Cure Light Wounds and healed by Cause Light Wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 2 turns\nThe caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Poison\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: 1’\nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level\nThis spell enables the priest to determine if an object has been poisoned or is poisonous. One object, or one 5-foot cubic mass, can be checked per round. The priest has a 5% chance per level of determining the exact type of poison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Snares and Pits\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 10 turns\nBy means of this spell, the caster can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.\nThis spell does detect certain natural hazards, for instance quicksand (detected as a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.\nThe amount of information revealed depends on how long the Druid studies a particular area.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards.\n2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside the Druid’s line of sight, then the caster discern its direction but not its exact location.\nEach Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by the caster.\n\nEach round, the Druid can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 ft of stone, 1 in of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 ft of wood or dirt blocks it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntagle\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1\nRange: 200’\nDuration: 3 rounds/level\nThis spell causes existing grasses, trees, bushes, shrubs, or other plants to entwine around creatures in a 40 ft x 40 ft area. At the DM’s discretion a caster underground may use roots of plants or trees if such are present. Most creatures within the area of effect move at ¼ normal speed; very large and/or very strong creatures (at least as big or strong as a giant or dragon) move at ½ normal speed.\nIf the creature affected is running at the time the spell is cast, the creature must make a saving throw vs Spell (with Dexterity bonus applied, if any) or trip and become prone and trapped until the end of spell. Entangled creatures may not attack nor take most actions other than movement due to the interference of the enchanted plants. This spell is only effective in a settings where plants will grow, including wilderness areas, farmland, and earthen-walled tunnels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaerie Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1, Magic-User 2\nRange: 200’ +10’/level\nDuration: 1 minute/level\nA pale glow surrounds and outlines all objects including individuals within a 20 ft radius from a point chosen by the caster. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, and the spell effectively negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects.\nThe light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 6 turns + 1/level\nThis spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.\nReversed, Light becomes Darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.\nA light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.\nEither version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A Light or Darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPass Without Trace\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell permits up to one creature per caster level to move through any type of terrain, leaving neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects by non-magical means is thus rendered impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurify Food and Water\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Swarm\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1, Magic-User 2\nRange: 60 Yards\nDuration: Special\nThe swarm of small animals (roll on following table to determine type, or the DM can assign an appropriate creature) drawn by the summon swarm spell will viciously attack all creatures in a 10 ft by 10ft area chosen by the caster. Creatures actively defending against the swarm to the exclusion of other activities suffer 1 point of damage for each round spent in the swarm. Those taking other actions, including leaving the swarm, receive damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per three levels of the caster each round. Note that spellcasting within the swarm is impossible.\n\n\n\nDice Roll\nSwarm Type\n\n\n\n\n01-40\nRats\n\n\n41-70\nBats\n\n\n71-80\nSpiders\n\n\n81-90\nCentipedes/beetles\n\n\n91-100\nFlying insects\n\n\n\nThe swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and area effects can force it to disperse by inflicting damage. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. A Protection From Evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as Gust of Wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (for example, only flyers are affected by a Gust of Wind). The caster must remain stationary and undisturbed to control the swarm; if their concentration lapses or is broken, the swarm disperses in two rounds. The swarm is stationary once conjured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarkskin\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 2, Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level\nWhen the Barkskin spell is cast upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 17, plus 1 AC for every two levels. Armor Class 18 at 4th level, Armor Class 19 at 6th, Armor Class 20 at 8th and so on.\nThis spell does not function in combination with normal armor or any magical protection. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature the caster touches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Animal\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Level+1d4 rounds\nThis spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the same fashion as Charm Person, at a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the DM) are allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will resume normal activity immediately.\nThis spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animals; if combined with Speak With Animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat Metal\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 25’\nDuration: 7 rounds\nThis spell causes a single item made of ferrous (iron-based) metal to become hot for a brief period of time. The affected item is warm to the touch immediately, and then becomes progressively hotter each round as indicated on the table below. The damage roll indicated is applied to any creature holding or wearing the affected item; a brief touch does no damage.\nNote that this spell can damage items harmed by heat, such as potions for example, and might boil water, wine, or oil stored in vessels within affected metal item, possibly causing an affected vessel to burst. Generally this will happen on the 4th or 5th round, when the effect is at its most powerful.\n\n\n\nRound\nTemperature\nDamage\n\n\n\n\n1st\nWarm\nNone\n\n\n2nd-3rd\nHot\n1d4\n\n\n4th-5th\nSearing\n2d4\n\n\n6th\nHot\n1d4\n\n\n7th\nWarm\nNone\n\n\n\nThe reverse of this spell is Chill Metal. It inflicts damage as outlined in the table above, but the damage is caused by cold instead of heat. Note that this can freeze water, congeal oil, and so on. Frozen water might burst its vessel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObscuring Mist\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2, Druid 2\nRange: 20’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes a bank of misty vapor to arise around the caster, remaining stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 2d4 ft. A strong wind can disperse the spell in one-quarter the usual duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce Flame/Cold\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 2\nRange: special\nDuration: 6 rounds/level\nFlames as bright as a torch appear in the caster’s open hand. The flames don’t harm the caster or their equipment. Alternatively, a bluish, cold aura may be produced, which also sheds light as bright as torch-light.\nIn addition to providing illumination, the flames or cold aura can be hurled or used to touch enemies. The caster can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire or cold damage respectively equal to 1d6, +1 points per caster level (maximum +5).\nAlternatively, the caster can hurl the flames or cold aura up to 50 ft as a thrown weapon. When doing so, the caster must make an attack roll (with no range penalty), and on a successful hit deals the same damage as the melee attack. As soon as the caster hurls the flames or cold aura, a new one appears in their hand. Each attack made reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends with that attack.\nNeither variation of this spell functions underwater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Cold\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a Fireball), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield of Thorns\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThick vines and thorny protrusions grow up and around the spell caster, hardening to provide protection and discouraging attacks. The wooden vine “armor” provides a +4 bonus to armor class. In addition, those attempting to strike the caster in close combat (melee attack) must save vs. Death Ray or take 1d4 point of damage from the thorns.\nThose attacking with weapons of length, such as spears or polearms, will not suffer such damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilence 15’ Radius\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 2 rounds/level\nUpon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15’ radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow Poison\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThe creature touched by the caster becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell’s duration does not affect the subject until the spell’s duration has expired. Slow poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done, with exception of the following circumstances.\nIf cast on a character who received lethal damage from poison the previous round, the spell will remove that round’s poison damage only, and delay it for the duration of the spell. Prior poison damage will remain unaffected, but, as noted above, no further damage is accrued until the spell lapses, and will never accrue if the poison is neutralized while this spell is in effect. This will give the poisoned victim an opportunity to seek a cure to neutralize the poison before it is fatal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Druid 2\nRange: Special\nDuration: 1 turn/4 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarp Wood*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2, Druid 2\nRange: 50’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster causes non-magical wood in a 20 ft radius to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open or becomes stuck; a boat or ship springs a leak; warped weapons (like bows and arrows) are useless. The caster may warp wood object(s) up to 1 ft on all sides per caster level.\nAlternatively, the caster can “Un-Warp” non-magical wood (effectively warping it back to normal), straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. The caster can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or un-warp) an object that is too large to warp with a single spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume Animal Form\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell allows the caster to change into the form of any natural animal. The assumed animal form cannot have more hit dice than the caster’s level. If slain, the caster reverts back to their original form.\nThe caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains their own mental abilities. The caster may remain transformed up to one hour per level, or end the spell earlier if the caster so desires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Lightning\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nImmediately upon completion of the spell, and at most once per round thereafter, the caster may call down a 5 ft wide, 30 ft long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell’s range (measured from the caster’s position at the time of casting). Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs. Spells reduces damage taken by half.\nThe caster needs not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first the caster may choose to call a bolt instead of taking some other normal action. The caster may call a total number of bolts equal to one-third of their caster level, rounded down.\nIf the caster is outdoors and in a stormy area – a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental) – each bolt deals 3d8 points of damage instead of 3d6.\nThis spell functions only where the open sky is accessible, generally meaning outdoors; bolts may be summoned through windows or skylights at the DM’s discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Disease*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nCure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.\nNote: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.\nThe reverse spell Cause Diseas infects the target creature with a debilitating disease, causing it to suffer from symptoms such as fever, weakness, or nausea. The affected creature must make a saving throw to resist the disease’s effects. On a failed save, the creature suffers ongoing damage and penalties to its abilities until the disease is cured. The exact effects of the disease and the duration of its affliction can vary depending on the caster’s level and the discretion of the Dungeon Master .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntangling Thorns\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThe druid chooses one target creature (or object) within range, beneath which great thorny tendrils quickly grow up and around. If the subject fails its save vs. Spells, it is held immobile, suffering a -2 penalty to hit and a -4 penalty to its armor class. In addition, the thorny growths cause 1d4 points of damage to the target each round. An individual so entangled may only cast spells if a DC 15 is achieved, modified by their primary spell casting ability score bonus.\nThe process of breaking free takes the entire round, during which damage is still incurred. Additionally, the thorny growths can be directly attacked (against AC 11) with small bladed weapons such as daggers or hand axes. The vines have 22 hp and destroying them ends the spell. Immediately. Using other larger weapons or spells will damage the entangled creature as much as the thorns, splitting the damage between them equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3\nRange: 60’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal’s carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the DM’s discretion).\nAll equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.\nThe spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Animal\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell functions like Hold Person, except that it affects only animals; specifically, this means non-magical living creatures of animal intelligence, including giant-sized animals. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralize Poison*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.\nReversed, this spell becomes Poison. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster’s touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Dead Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn\nThis spell enables a druid to commune with the spirits of deceased animals. The spirits manifest as faint, ethereal forms of the animals they once were. During the spell’s duration, the druid can ask the spirit up to five questions. The spirits are limited by their intelligence and memories, so the responses may be fragmented or cryptic, especially if they were simple creatures in life. The spirit havs knowledge of events that occurred within their lifetime and in the vicinity where they dwelled.\nThe types of questions that can be asked might include details about their surroundings before their demise, any dangers they encountered, or information about other creatures or individuals they interacted with.\nThe DM determines the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the spirit based on their individual circumstances and the nature of their passing. Additionally, the spirits may have their own personalities and biases, which could influence the clarity and truthfulness of their responses. Once all five questions have been asked or the spell’s duration ends, the spirit returns to the afterlife, and the spell’s effects cease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Monsters\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 3\nRange: Special\nDuration: 1 turn/5 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: Special\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines) within 400 ft. + 40 ft./caster level to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Movement rate is reduced to a maximum of 5 ft./round, or 10 ft for Large creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. An area up to 100 ft radius may thus be altered. Also, the caster may specify an area (a path, a clearing, etc.) within the given area of effect, which is not so affected.\nThis spell has no effect on plant creatures, that is, any self-willed and/or animated plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nIf the caster touches himself or herself, this spell grants temporary immunity to fire (normal and magic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of magical fire damage, it is discharged. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\nIf the spell is cast upon another creature than the caster, Protection From Fire grants temporary immunity against normal fire. The spell also offers a +4 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and if the save is successful, the creature suffers no damage (and only 25% if the save fails). This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Curse*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nRemove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.\nThe reverse of this spell, Bestow Curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:\n–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).\n–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.\nEach round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.\nThe caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a Remove Curse spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Breathing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThe affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Woodland Beings\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell summons woodland creatures. They appear where the caster designates and act immediately, on their turn (they cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them). They attack the caster opponents to the best of their ability. If the caster can communicate with the creatures, the caster can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to perform other actions.\nThe caster may conjure one type of creature from this list, at their option:\n\n4 Centaurs,\n16 Pixies,\n2 Treants, or\n4 Unicorns\n\nThis spell only works outdoors in a natural location and will not function within the boundaries of any village, town, or city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Temperature, 10’ Radius\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4\nRange: 0’\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThe caster can change automatically the surrounding temperature (10 ft radius sphere) by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit per caster level. The change can be upward or downward (caster’s choice)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Serious Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell works exactly like Cure Light Wounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, Cause Serious Wounds, also works exactly like Cause Light Wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Plants*\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 6\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a 10’x100’ area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.\nThe reverse form, Shrink Plants, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version.\nGrowth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by Dispel Magic. This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallucinatory Terrain\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: 400’ + 40’/level\nDuration: 2 turns/level\nThis spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to cast.\nThe affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs. Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Water\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 6\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.\nWhen cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a Slow spell (the reverse of Haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Lightning\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nThis spell functions exactly like Protection From Fire, except that that it protects against any sort of electrical or lightning damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: 20’\nDuration: 1 turn\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform “services” other than to answer questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSticks to Snakes\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStone Shape\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Druid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to shape, bend, and form an existing piece of stone (of up to 10 cubic ft + 1 cubic ft per level) into any shape the caster wishes.\nFine detail is not possible but primitive doors, walls, bridges, or similar items can be created with this spell. Stone shaped in the form of moving or mechanical parts will not work on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Animals I\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4\nRange: 40’/level\nDuration: One hour\nThis spell summons 1d8 ordinary animals (including giant ones) of no more than 4 HD each if they are within range. The Druid must name the type of animal summoned, and can have up to three choices. If none of the three species are found within range, the spell fails. The animals will be friendly when summoned and aid the Druid’s current task, including combat, in whatever way they can (to the best of their understanding). The Druid may dismiss any animals called by this spell at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree Sanctuary\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell enables a Druid to create an invisible door in the trunk of a tree that is visible only to dryads and other Druids. The tree must be at least 10 ft tall and planted into the earth for this spell to work. Once the spell is complete, the Druid may enter the tree, effectively disappearing from sight. Only one tree may be affected by tree sanctuary at a time. Furthermore, this spell may only be cast on a tree occupied by a dryad if the dryad allows it.\nThe Druid is completely aware of their surroundings while in the tree, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the tree. The Druid may meditate to memorize spells in the tree. Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Druid sleeps inside the tree counts as a full hour of sleep. Also, if the tree is an oak, the Druid heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the tree.\nThe Druid however loses the senses of taste, smell, and touch, and may not speak or cast spells while inside the tree. The Druid takes half of any damage the tree suffers, and if the tree is destroyed or cut down, the Druid is cast out into the nearest available space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommune Wtih Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5\nRange: See text\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster becomes one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. After 10 minutes of concentration, the caster instantly gains knowledge of one fact per caster level among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, presence of settlement or structure, or even the general state of the natural setting.\nIn outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings – caves, caverns, and the like – the radius is limited to 100 ft per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjure Elemental\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 240’\nDuration: Special\nA portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only Dispel Magic or Dispel Evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignor’s Wind Mastery\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 0’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster alters wind force around them (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high). The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration. The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to 40 ft radius around them and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than their full limit.\nThe caster may choose wind patterns over the spell’s area. The caster can choose a downdraft blows from the center outward, an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.\nFor every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30 yards\nDuration: 1 rd/level\nA Dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.\nAny creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.\nThe spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlame Strike\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Instantaneoous\nA Flame Strike produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high). The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGust of Wind\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 3\nRange: 10’ x 10 yds/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nWhen this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the caster and moves in the direction the caster is facing. The force of this Gust of Wind (about 30 m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames–such as those of lanterns–to dance wildly and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spellcaster to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind’s movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures.\nIts path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level wizard causes a Gust of Wind that travels 80 yards).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsect Plague\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: 300’+30’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock to Mud*\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 150’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud; up to two 10 ft cubes per caster level may be so transformed. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 ft. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 ft and causing it to suffer a ‑2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and armor class. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 ft., suffering none of the other penalties given.\nIf rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool to a depth of 5 ft. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.\nCastles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since Rock to Mud cannot affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such a buildings’ foundation. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.\nThe mud remains until a successful Dispel Magic or Mud to Rock spell restores its substance (though not necessarily its form). Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.\nWhen using the reverse, Mud to Rock, the spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently. Any creature in the mud must save vs. Death Ray to escape before the area transforms into rock (assuming it has enough movement to do so).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Animals II\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5\nRange: 60’/level\nDuration: One day\nThis spell is a more powerful version of Summon Animals I. Up to 3d4 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 1d6 animals of 8 HD or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing of Lesser Healing*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: 15’ radius\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell Cure Light Wounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This spell thus cures 1d6+1 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.\nThe reverse of this spell, Ring of Lesser Infliction, allows the caster to cast Cause Light Wounds on multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This form of the spell causes 1d6+1 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Seeing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.\nTrue seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a Crystal ball or in conjunction with Clairvoyance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 1 round/level (or special)\nAn immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster’s turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.\nThe wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).\nIf the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 15’/level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, 1’ thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\nThe caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape the caster desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Natural Objects\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell functions identically to the cleric spell Animate Objects, but it may only be cast on living trees, plants, or fungi, wooden objects, un-worked stone or earth, or naturally-occurring bodies of water or ice. At the DM’s option other natural phenomena such as non-magical fires or weather effects might also be subject to this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Path\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.\nThe locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting.\nThe spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Water\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell, when cast on a body of water, causes it to part. This exposes a path that can be traversed as if it where dry land. Note that this spell does not change the topography of the bottom of the body of water, so the terrain my still be difficult to cross. The caster is able to affect a body of water up to 5 ft./caster level. The caster may dismiss this spell at any time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPass Tree\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster and up to two others to teleport between any two living trees on the same plane. The caster chooses a general location or a specific tree. The caster must have personal knowledge of the specific tree or general area of the target destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeal*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nHeal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue, Feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all but 1d4 of the target’s hit points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.\nThe reversed spell, Harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which Harm may kill a creature).\nGenerally, both Heal and Harm only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove Earth\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Concentration (up to 2 hours)\nThe druid may choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range and reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner for the duration. The caster can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension.\nSo, if the caster affects a 40-foot square, the druid can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the end of every 10 minutes spent concentrating on the spell, the druid can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.\nThis spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\nSimilarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReincarnate\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6, Magic-user 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nRoll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes:\n\n\n\nd%\nIncarnation\n\n\n\n\n01–02\nBugbear\n\n\n03–17\nDwarf\n\n\n18–28\nElf\n\n\n29\nGnoll\n\n\n30–39\nGnome\n\n\n40–44\nGoblin\n\n\n45–63\nHalfling\n\n\n64–88\nHuman\n\n\n89–92\nKobold\n\n\n93\nLizard Man\n\n\n94–98\nOrc\n\n\n99\nTroglodyte\n\n\n100\nOther (DM’s choice)\n\n\n\nSince the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\nA reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the DM as needed.) The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character’s original hit point total; this is the new form’s hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.\nA character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Animals III\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6\nRange: 80’/level\nDuration: One day\nThis spell is a more powerful version of Summon Animals II. Up to 4d6 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 3d4 animals of 8 HD or less, or 1d4 animals of 12 HD or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Summoning\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6, Magic-User 6\nRange: 10 miles\nDuration: 5 turns/level\nThe caster is able to summon nearby weather conditions. The caster must be aware of the weather condition to summon it. This spell does not grant control of the weather to the caster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of Recall\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 6\nRange: Self (special)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWord of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).\nAn unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 7, Druid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Magic Shell\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7, Magic-user 6\nRange: 10’ Radius\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nWithin a 10’ radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Weather\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 2 miles\nDuration: 4d12 hours\nThe caster can change the weather in the local area. Any kind of weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area may be invoked. It takes 10 minutes for the weather to change to the desired conditions. For the duration of the spell, the caster may again change the conditions, but any such change will take another 10 minutes for the new conditions to arrive.\nThe caster has control over the general conditions of the weather, such as the direction and force of the winds, whether lightning is occurring, whether there is a tornado, and other directives. But, there is no specific control, so lightning cannot be forced to hit a particular spot and the path of a tornado cannot be dictated.\nThe spell allows the caster to remove conditions as well as bring them. (For example, an existing tornado can be replaced with calm weather.) At the end of the spell, the current conditions will continue, the caster just won’t be able to control them anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthquake\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 400’ + 40’/level\nDuration: 1 round\nWhen cast, this spell causes a powerful, but localized, earthquake that is 10 feet in diameter per caster level. The shock of the quake will knock down creatures, topple plants, collapse structures, open cracks in the earth, and more. The effect lasts for one round, during which creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area. The specific effect depends on the type of terrain where the spell is cast:\n• Cave, cavern, tunnel: Causes the roof to collapse causing 8d6 damage to everyone in the affected area (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble. Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.\n• Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.\n• Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures in the area have a 1 in 4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.\n• Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring hardness. If this causes the structure to collapse, anyone trapped inside takes 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.\n• River, lake, marsh: Fissures in the bottom drain the water away, resulting in a muddy quicksand-like surface to remain. All creatures in the affected area must save vs. Death Ray or be stuck. After the end of the spell, the surrounding water rushes back in, potentially drowning any creatures stuck in the mud.\nAny creature pinned by rubble takes 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per minute until rescued or they fall unconscious. Once unconscious, they take 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until they are rescued or die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaerie Ring\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 7\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nWhen the caster creates a Faerie Ring, a small circle of distinct mushrooms or toadstools grow quickly. Those that walk into the circle (about 5 foot diameter) are transported into a region that borders the FeyWild (another plane of existence). This region can be utilized as a safe place to rest and recuperate (at double normal rate for purpose of healing and restoration of spells). From this border region, one may pass back into the familiar prime world or they might travel to the actual FeyWild.\nThe Feywild is the Plane of Faeries and it intersects with the OnceWas. The FeyWild is an echo of the real world but suffused with potent magic and unrestrained emotions. As an echo of OnceWas, its geography is similar although not entirely identical. The landscape is markedly more dramatic and beautiful with more trees and flowers. The mountains stand straighter and sharper. The rivers flow clearer and faster, the flowers bloom brighter and more fragrantly, and the weather manifests in supernatural ways.\nTime does not flow the same in the Feywild as it does in the OnceWas. While any visitor would experience time flowing as normal, it is often the case that more time was passing in the real world, sometimes on the order of weeks, months, or years longer than expected.\nMore concerning, leaving the Feywild can have dire consequences. Lost time could suddenly “catch up” to a mortal, sending them into fits of exhaustion or hunger, or even killing them instantly if many years had passed. Often, memories of time spent in the Feywild become hazy and dreamlike, if not vanishing altogether.\nIt is said to be the place from where the first elves originated.\nKi, goddess of life and nature and Queen of faeries, is known to spend time in the FeyWild when not in Elysium or in the OnceWas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell causes an area 20’x10’x10’ per caster level to be filled with holy fire. The caster can determine the shape of the area, but the entire area must be contiguous. Any creature in the designated area takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any immunity or resistance to fire. Any creature that dies from the damage (or was already dead when the fire storm is cast) is completely consumed by the fire. The fire only harms creatures and does not affect the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerate\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.\nThis spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoration*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nEach casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the Healing section) for more details.\nAlternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.\nRestoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for the spell Raise Dead).\nThe reverse, Energy Drain, draws away one life energy level like a wight. The energy drain requires the victim to be touched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse Gravity\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 7, Magic-User 7\nRange: 5 yds/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell reverses gravity in a 30’ x 30’ area of effect, causing all unattached objects and creatures within it to “fall” upward. The reverse gravity lasts as long as the caster desires or until the spell expires. If some solid object is encountered in this “fall,” the object strikes it in the same manner as it would during a normal downward fall. At the end of the spell duration, the affected objects and creatures fall downward. As the spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, or even thousands of feet in the air above the area can be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing of Greater Healing*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: 15’ radius\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell Cure Serious Wounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This spell thus cures 3d6+3 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.\nThe reverse of this spell, Ring of Greater Infliction, allows the caster to cast Cause Serious Wounds on multiple creatures within a 15’ radius. This form of the spell causes 3d6+3 points of damage to one living creature per 3 levels of the caster. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may damage, then the caster must choose which creatures are affected. Those targeted are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully. Undead creatures affected by this spell receive healing rather than suffering damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Thorns\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 7\nRange: 15’/level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates a wall of tough, tangled brambles bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. If the subject fails its save vs. Spells it is Entangled and held immobile, suffering a -2 penalty to hit and a -4 penalty to its armor class. In addition, the thorny growths cause 1d8 points of damage to the target each round. An individual so entangled may only cast spells if a DC 15 is achieved, modified by their primary spell casting ability score bonus.\nA creature can move through the wall ay 5’ per round suffering 1d8 points of damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Walk\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell alters the substance of the caster’s body to a cloud-like vapor (as the Gaseous Form spell) and the caster can move through the air, potentially at great speed. Other creatures can be touched by the caster, which causes them to be affected by the spell, too, each of whom acts independently. Up to one additional person per three caster levels my be included in the spell.\nWhile under the spell, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet, able to move any direction at any time. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round, but maneuverability becomes very poor. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.\nFor the duration of the spell, each participant may freely switch between its physical form and its vaporous form as desired, but each change takes five rounds. The caster can dismiss the spell at any time, either individually or for everyone at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User Spells\nMagic-Users cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and will. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each Magic-User has his or her own spellbook containing the magical formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned. Spellbooks are written in a magical script that can only be read by the one who wrote it, or through the use of the spell Read Magic. All Magic-Users begin play knowing Read Magic, and it is so ingrained that it can be prepared without a spellbook.\nA Magic-User may only prepare spells after resting (i.e. a good night’s sleep), and needs one turn per each three spell levels to do so (rounding fractions up). Spells prepared but not used on a previous day are not lost. For example, a 3rd level Magic-User preparing all three of his or her available spells (two 1st level and one 2nd level) is preparing a total of 4 levels of spells, and thus needs 2 turns (4 divided by 3 and rounded up).\nRules for the acquisition of new spells are found in the Dungeon Master ’s section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0, Magic-User (Cantrips)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Tool\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nA single, small tool (such as a quill pen, spoon, sewing needle, or small hammer) is animated by this cantrip. It will perform a single, repetitive task (such as writing dictated words, stirring a pot of soup, sewing the hem of a dress, or nailing boards into a house) for as long as a turn.\nThe magic user must be able to perform the repeated action by hand himself. Weapons may not be animated by this cantrip, and objects animated may not be used as weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcane Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis inherent magic is a bolt of raw arcane power. The Magic-User doesn’t roll anything, but the target gets a save vs. magic to avoid all damage. The bolt has a range of 30 feet and does 1d4 damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures, which are only affected by magical weapons, but do not affect inanimate objects.\nThe Feat Arcane Bolt, Greater (Magic User only) improves Arcane Bolt. The Target gets a save vs. magic for half damage. The bolt has a range of 40 feet and does 1d6 damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures, which are only affected by magical weapons. The spell does not affect inanimate objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA mage making use of this cantrip may clean, shine, dust, or polish a small object or surface of up to 1 square foot. Reversed, this becomes Dirty, which can make the same area dirty, tarnished, scuffed, or dusty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDancing Lights\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nDepending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.\nDancing lights can be made permanent with a Permanency spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlare\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 20’ + 5’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA flash of light, a very small ball of fire, or a puff of colored smoke can be created by this cantrip. They will not typically last longer than a second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavor*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 20’ + 5’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis cantrip may either make one dish taste any way the caster wants it to (which is an illusion), or add salt, spice, sweetener, or another flavoring agent (which is real). Reversed, it becomes Putrefy, which makes the food or drink either go bad (which is real) or taste as if it had been prepared wrongly (which is an illusion).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 10’ + 5’/level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis cantrip engraves up to 1 square foot of writing or drawing on almost any nonliving surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrritate\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 20’ + 5’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis cantrip forces another person to involuntarily blink, nod, itch, giggle, or some other small body motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnot*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Intantaneous\nThis spell may tightly knot or tangle a rope, string, or similar object in any knot the caster would be able to tie. Reversed, the Unknot spell may undo any knot the caster could unknot himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Intantaneous\nA normal, unlocked door, window, or other portal may be opened by this cantrip. Reversed, the Close spell will close a normal, open door, window, or other portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: 0’\nDuration: Permanent\nAll Magic-Users are able to read magic.\nWhen cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to their spellbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Vermin*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 0, Druid 0\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis cantrip/orison summons one small, totally ordinary insect (such as a beetle, fly, or spider), a small rodent (such as a field mouse), or a cloud of gnats into a certain area. If targeted intelligently, the spell may be able to disrupt spellcasting, but will never deal any actual damage (including poison) to the target. Reversed, this cantrip becomes Exterminate, which may kill any one creature of similar size as the ones described in the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZagig’s Canned Laughter\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 0\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThe spell just makes a laugh track play any time the caster jokes, for one round per level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlarm\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 20’ + 10’/level\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nAlarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time any creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the caster at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. The caster decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.\nMental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster (and only the caster) so long as the caster remains within 1 mile of the warded area. The caster will hear a single mental “ping” sufficient to awaken the caster from normal sleep, but which does not otherwise disturb concentration. A Silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.\nAudible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 ft of the warded area can hear it clearly. Interposing doors or walls may reduce the distance by 10 ft or 20 ft. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a Silence spell cannot hear the ringing.\nIncorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurning Hands\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Special\nDuration: 1 round\nWhen the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from their fingertips. Their hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: The wizard’s thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets 5 feet long in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard.\nAny creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. Flammable materials touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Person\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the DM’s discretion). The caster must speak the target’s language to communicate any commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster’s enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe” place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChill\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 2 rounds\nThis spell does 1d4 points of damage to one creature within range. Furthermore, the creature must save vs. Paralysis or suffer -1 to melee hit and damage rolls for 1d6 rounds. A large heat source nearby gives a +2 to save. The caster may use this spell on one target up to 2 rounds after casting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorpse Servant\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell allows the caster to temporarily animate skeletons or zombies. A number of hit dice equal to the caster’s level may be animated for up to one hour per caster level. These non-permanent undead do not count towards the Re-animation spell limitations, but they otherwise conform to the permanent undead created by that spell. Only one instance of this spell may be active at a time for any particular caster.\nAnimated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecay Flesh\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis is a version of the Cause Light Wounds spell dealing 1d6+1 points of damage to the creature affected by it. The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage. A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or until a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level have passed.\nUnlike the Clerical spell mentioned, this spell may not be reversed. However, this spell does work upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed 1d6+1 hit points instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Druid 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 2 turns\nThe caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 5 yards/level\nDuration: 5 rounds/level\nThis spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the magic-user, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight will increase cubicly.\nAll equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials–the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.\nMagical properties are not increased by this spell–a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.\nFor example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with their long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.\nThe reverse spell, Reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch–the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.\nFor example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level magic-user (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamiliar\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nWith this spell, the caster binds a single animal into their service as a familiar. The spell requires 10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier. The creature must be present, and the caster must touch it to cast the spell.\nOnly normal (non-magical) creatures of 1-1 hit die may be made into familiars. Further, each spellcaster may have only one familiar at a time. If a familiar dies, the caster will not be able to successfully cast this spell again for 2d6 months (the period to be rolled by the DM and not revealed to the player). A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist, and if this roll succeeds, the animal chosen is not compatible with the caster and cannot become their familiar.\nThe familiar will behave as if permanently charmed by its master and will perform any task assigned to it to the best of its ability. The creature’s morale is increased by 2 points (to a maximum of 11), and it receives improved intelligence equal to 3+1d4 points. Familiars also age at half the normal rate for their kind, so a cat familiar (for instance) might easily live forty years.\nThe familiar’s hit points are added to the Magic User ’s. If a familiar is slain, the Magic User loses double the familiar’s hit points, permanently.\nIn combat, it shares initiative and acts at the end of the Magic User’s turn.\nWithin 200 feet, the Magic User can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears, returning to the Magic User’s senses at will. During this time, the Magic User is deaf and blind regarding their own senses.\nAdditionally, while the familiar is within 100 feet of the Magic User, they can communicate telepathically. This communication is in simple telepathic concepts, such as “3 angry people. One is short” or “path forks, 3 ways ahead, smells like food”. Not enough detail for a map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeather Fall\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 10 yards/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nWhen this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 2 feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard.\nThe feather fall affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.\nFor example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. Note that the spell can be effectively combined with Gust of Wind and similar spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloating Disk\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 0\nDuration: 5 turns +1/level\nThis spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield, being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable.\nThe disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster’s waist. It remains still when within 10’ of the caster, and follows at the caster’s movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10’ from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the surface beneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrease\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 10 yards\nDuration: 1 turns +1/level\nA grease spell covers a 10 x 10 ft material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can reach the nearest nongreased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured!\nThe spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item–a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item. The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise, it lasts for 1 turn plus one turn per level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Portal\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A Knock spell or a successful Dispel Magic spell can negate a hold portal spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe individual touched when this spell is cast is empowered to leap once per round for the duration of the spell. Leaps can be up to 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or backward have only a slight arc–about 2 feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The jump spell does not ensure safety in landing or grasping at the end of the leap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: 120’\nDuration: 6 turns + 1/level\nThis spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.\nReversed, Light becomes Darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.\nA light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.\nEither version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A Light or Darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate Corpse\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to sense the direction of the closest corpse or remains of a type usable for spells such as Re-animation or other similar spells. Throughout the duration, the caster need simply concentrate on the general type of corpse (animal, humanoid, large size, etc) and of applicable state (intact, fresh, skeletal, etc). The nearest remains fitting the criteria is located if more than one is within range. Upon arrival at the location of the nearest corpse, the caster can again concentrate to locate another corpse, as long as the spell duration lasts.\nSpecific remains belonging to a particular individual can be located with this spell, so long as the caster knew the individual personally during life. This spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures, whether living or in states of undeath, cannot be found by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMage Armor\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn\nThis spell creates a magical armor which protects the caster. The caster’s skin becomes hard and stone-like, giving the caster a +2 bonus to armor class vs. melee attacks and hand-thrown missiles such as daggers or spears, and a +4 bonus to armor class vs. normal sized projectiles such as arrows, bolts, sling stones, and sling bullets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMage Hand\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 40’\nDuration: 10 rounds\nA spectral hand is conjured, which may either move one pound of materials at a speed of 10 feet per round for ten rounds (at a maximum range of 40 feet), or give an object a powerful push about equal to the caster’s strength at a range of 10 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Missile\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from the caster’s fingertip and strike its target, which must be at least partially visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.\nFor every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile is fired – two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. If the caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is rolled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Mouth\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long, can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the caster’s, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster’s command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb.\nThe range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThis spell summons a riding horse or pony (caster’s choice) to serve as a mount. The mount comes with bit, bridle, and saddle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is left to the individual DM to decide.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a Magic Jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the Protection From Evil effect. If the Protection From Evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\nReversed, this spell becomes Protection From Good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection From Undead*\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell works almost identically to the Protection From Evil spell by warding a creature from attacks by undead creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures regardless of any moral or ethical leanings. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and on saves. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by undead creatures or beings that the DM decides have a strong connection with death or undead.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a Magic Jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the Protection from Undead spell. If the Protection From Undead effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are undead or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\nReversed, this spell becomes quite potent as Protection From Living. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “living” creatures are kept away, rather than dead or “undead” creatures. Black Magic-Users often use both versions of the spell to protect themselves from threats by both the living population as well as powerful undead that may try to command the Black Magic-User such as ghosts or vampires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Languages\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 0\nDuration: Special\nThis spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:\nIn the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\nIn the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.\nIn the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.\nThis spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see Read Magic, for the correct spell to use in such cases.\nThe spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn’t otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature’s mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 0\nMagic-User 1\nDuration: Permanent\nWhen cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to his or her spellbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Self\nDuration: 5 rounds+1/level\nShield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the caster. It negates Magic Missile attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster’s Armor Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but  Magic Missile are warded off from all directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 90’\nDuration: 5 rounds/level\nThis spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30’ of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the effect.\nSleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures, and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.\nWhen the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally, at the DM’s option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpider Climb\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nA Spider Climb spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner, at a their usual walking movement rate.\nDuring the course of the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weigh less than a dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to their hands and feet. Thus, a wizard will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell effect with a word\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 3 rounds/level\nThis spell enables the caster to change their own staff into a magical weapon that gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll and inflicts 2d4 +1 points of damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStench\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 1\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell creates a sickly stinking smell of rot and decay that emanates from the caster’s body. The stench duplicates the sickening effect of ghasts (see its entry in the Monster section). The smell of death and corruption surrounding the caster is so overwhelming that living creatures within 10 feet must succeed a save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls).\nFor every three levels the caster has, a penalty of ‑1 on the save is applied to those affected (at 3rd the save is at -1, at 6th level at -2, at 9th level at -3, etc). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by this spell or a ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A Neutralize Poison Spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnseen Servant\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 50’\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nAn unseen servant is an invisible servant that is shapeless and mindless. It can be used to fetch things, return things, open doors, hold chairs, clean things, and mend things. It is not strong, having an effective strength of 3. It can only open normal doors, chests, lids, containers, and such subject to its minimal strength. The servant cannot fight, nor can it be destroyed, but it can always be dismissed at any time prior to the spell’s end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentriloquism\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 1\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark alcove or statue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlter Self\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can alter their appearance and form–including clothing and equipment–to appear taller or shorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster’s body can undergo a limited physical alteration and their size can be changed up to 50%.\nThe caster’s Hit Points, attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, or defenses. Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. The caster can change back into their own form at will; this ends the spell immediately. A caster who is slain automatically returns to their normal form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 5’\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell permits the caster to discover information about a magic item or a permanently enchanted area. For each turn spent studying the enchanted item or area, the caster may learn one feature of the enchantment. Features include spell effects, bonuses, and command words or activating conditions. The DM will choose the order in which the features are revealed, but command words or activating conditions should be last. Note that the number of charges remaining for a charged item is not revealed by this spell.\nEach turn of study requires the caster to make a d20 roll, adding their Intelligence bonus and level. The total result must be 16 or higher to succeed; any failure ends the spell. A natural 1 is always a failure.\nThe item or area to be studied must be within 5’ of the caster for the full duration of scrutiny, and the caster must maintain moderate concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoneskin\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster manifests a chitinous bone-like armor, giving a +4 bonus to AC. The boney bulk that is added doesn’t affect other spell casting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Undead\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell allows the caster to influence an undead creature. If the undead creature is intelligent, this spell operates as charm person, except that the caster can influence 2 HD per caster level, instead of just a flat 4 HD. It otherwise operates the same, including duration.\nIf the undead creature is unintelligent, the caster immediately gains complete control, the creature gets no saving throw, and the duration is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the total control limit from re-animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinual Light*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 year/level\nThis spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30’ radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the Light spell, up to a maximum range of 360’ from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.\nAs with Light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.\nThe reversed spell, Continual Darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Flame\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster produces a magical “dark flame” upon an object that does not produce heat or use oxygen. However, the magical dark flames allow all within 30 feet radius to see via Darkvision within the spell area, much like a normal lit torchwould allow for normal vision. The darkvision does not extend beyond the spell radius, and neither does the effect extend to any who might leave the area of effect. The spell does not provide any stealth bonus within the effect, as all (including foes) receive the darkvision. However, because there is no light produced it may augment stealthy movement in general against those outside the spell range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the DM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes Detect Good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Invisible\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nBy means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing them as translucent shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESP\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of one or more targets within range. The caster must designate a direction, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear” the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way.\nRock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEther Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 30’ + 5’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell fires off a missile or beam-like effect that only strikes foes that are insubstantial, ethereal, phase-shifted, or otherwise not fully materially present. This primarily includes various types of undead, but may include other beings that have similar qualities such as shadows. Much like a magic missile, the bolt strikes unerringly if the target is in sight, causing 1d4 points of force-like impact damage per level of the caster, striking as if the target was a completely solid being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaerie Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1, Magic-User 2\nRange: 200’ +10’/level\nDuration: 1 minute/level\nA pale glow surrounds and outlines all objects including individuals within a 20 ft radius from a point chosen by the caster. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, and the spell effectively negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects.\nThe light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireskull Familiar\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell animates a single skull to serve the Black Magic-User. Wrapped in cold magical flames and gifted with a form of levitation-based flight, the flaming skull can fetch small items, convey messages, or other similar tasks for the Black Magic-User. When not tasked with a specific duty, the fireskull familiar generally hovers near its master, providing light equal to torchlight. A Black Magic-User may have only one instance of this spell active at a time. Subsequent castings have no effect unless the first instance of the spell is dismissed or destroyed.\nThe fireskull familiar is not designed for combat, having hit points equal to 25% of the Black Magic-User’s total hit points. The skull has an Armor Class of 13 and only a single attack for 1d2 points of damage, attacking with the same basic chance to hit as the Black Magic-User. The skull can be charged with spells that must be delivered by touch, with the spell effect being available to the skull on the following round. While a fireskull familiar is within 5 feet, the caster’s chance of being surprised is reduced by 1.\nOf interesting note, although each skull does not remember any details of its former life, it does retain many personality traits, making each skull distinct from the next. Practitioners of this spell often have favorite skulls that they use regularly, and skulls that they are loathe to animate. Any particular skull that is destroyed through damage may never again be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFist of Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: Permanent\nUpon completion of this spell, one of the caster’s hands (their choice) turns to stone. It is flexible and can be used to punch, smash, or crush objects and opponents as if the wizard had Strength of 18/00. Combat bonuses for Strength do not apply if the caster uses any weapon other than their fist.\nWhile the spell is in effect, the wizard cannot cast spells requiring somatic components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForget\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Permanent\nBy means of this spell, the spellcaster causes creatures within a 20ft cube area of effect to forget the events of the previous six rounds (the one minute of time previous to the utterance of the spell). For every three levels of experience of the spellcaster, another minute of past time is forgotten. This does not negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells, but it is possible that the being who placed such magic upon the recipient could be forgotten.\nFrom one to four creatures can be affected, at the discretion of the caster. If only one is to be affected, the recipient saves vs. spell with a -2 penalty; if two, they save with -1 penalties; if three or four are to be affected, they save normally. All saving throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A priest’s heal or restoration spell, if specially cast for this purpose, will restore the lost memories, as will a limited wish or wish, but no other means will do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForget\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Permanent\nBy means of this spell, the spellcaster causes creatures within a 20ft cube area of effect to forget the events of the previous six rounds (the one minute of time previous to the utterance of the spell). For every three levels of experience of the spellcaster, another minute of past time is forgotten. This does not negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells, but it is possible that the being who placed such magic upon the recipient could be forgotten.\nFrom one to four creatures can be affected, at the discretion of the caster.

A priest’s heal or restoration spell, if specially cast for this purpose, will restore the lost memories, as will a limited wish or wish, but no other means will do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForked Lightning\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 25’ + 5’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nTwo arcs of electricity spring from the casters fingers to strike two separate adjacent targets within 10 foot of each other. For each bolt the caster must roll to hit their chosen target ignoring any worn armor and metal armored targets get +4 bonus to hit (any magical bonuses still apply). Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by this spell.\nEach bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage +1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (round down). For every two levels past 3rd (5th, 7th, 9th, etc) the caster gains an additional bolt of forked lightning. Subsequent targets (after first two) must be within 10 feet of the previously targeted foe, and a new attack roll must be made for each bolt. If there are fewer than the maximum allowed targets then the extra bolts do not appear and are wasted; a single bolt can only strike a single creature.\nThere is no save to resist the spell once struck by a bolt, but creatures with any sort of resistance to electrical attacks will suffer no damage whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhoulish Hands\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell causes the hands of one living creature to become like the horrible claws of ghouls. The bearer of these ghoulish hands may make two claw attacks that cause 1d4 points of damage each. If the recipient of this spell already had better claw attacks, then the caster gains a +2 damage bonus to their damage rolls while this spell is in effect. In addition to the damage, those struck by the hands must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns (Elves are immune), exactly like the attacks of a ghoul.\nRecipients of this spell must be true living creatures; other creatures such as undead, constructs, elementals, and the like are immune. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance that on any particular casting of this spell that the recipient is actually infected with Ghoul Fever (per the monster description), which if proper curative steps are not taken, may ultimately result in the recipient’s death and rising as an actual ghoul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIggwilv’s Mirror Image\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster. The images move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and remain in a cluster around them. The figments mimic the caster’s actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.\nEnemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisibility\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nThe creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.\nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).\nThe spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnock\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Special\nThe knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, Held, or Wizard Locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a Wizard Locked door, the spell does not remove the Wizard Locked but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo a single means of preventing access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevitate\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: Touch\nMagic-User 2\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nLevitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round, by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).\nA levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate Object\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as Clairvoyance or a Crystal Ball). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggot Spray\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nFrom the caster’s mouth sprays a stream of filth containing live flesh-eating maggots, affecting all within a 10-foot section immediately adjacent to and chosen by the caster. Those struck by the spray must save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (like the Stench spell, causing a penalty of -2 to their attacks). Additionally, the maggots eat into the flesh, causing 1d4 points of damage immediately and on subsequent rounds an additional 1d4 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level. Individuals may stop the damage by using an entire round to brush off the maggots (no movement, attacks, and loss of any dexterity or shield bonuses during this round). Those taking the time to brush off the maggots take normal damage that round. Removing the maggots does not remove the sickening effect of those who failed their save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nWhen this spell is cast, the caster can whisper messages and receive replies with little chance of being overheard. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses each creature to be included in the spell effect (up to one creature per level). When the caster whispers, the whispered message travels in a straight line and is audible to all of the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus 10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that is heard by the spell caster. Note that there must be an unobstructed path between the caster and the recipients.\nThe message must be in a language the caster speaks; this spell does not by itself confer understanding upon the recipients. This spell is most often used to conduct quick and private conferences when the caster does not wish to be overheard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor Warding\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nThis spell cloaks an object of less than 10 cubic feet with an invisible aura of harmful energy. Thereafter, the first living creature touching the object sets off the ward, receiving 3d6 points of damage; no saving throw is allowed to avoid the damage. The object is unaffected by the discharge of the minor ward.\nNon-living creatures such as undead or golems will not set off a minor ward. The caster is free to handle the object at will. The maximum duration of the spell is 1 hour per level of the caster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObscuring Mist\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2, Druid 2\nRange: 20’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes a bank of misty vapor to arise around the caster, remaining stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 2d4 ft. A strong wind can disperse the spell in one-quarter the usual duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhantasmal Force\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 180’\nDuration: Concentration\nThis spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of 20’x20’x20’. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.\nIf used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.\nAttempting to animate more creatures than the caster’s level grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be granted by the DM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Staff\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster’s staff is transformed into the substance of shadow. When used in combat the staff is treated as a magical weapon (initially +1 to hit and damage) and each hit will drain 1 point of strength from the target (save vs. Spells to avoid). For each point drained, the staff’s magical bonus is increased by one (up to a maximum bonus of +5), lasting until the end of the spell. The shadow staff can only be wielded by the caster. The draining effect does combine with any inherent magical qualities of the caster’s staff, if such exist. Use best magical bonus, either the magical staff’s inherent bonus or the magic from the spell’s draining ability, whichever is better on any particular round (as the bonus from the spell can potentially increase over time to become better than the inherent magical ability of the staff in question).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Swarm\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 1, Magic-User 2\nRange: 60 Yards\nDuration: Special\nThe swarm of small animals (roll on following table to determine type, or the DM can assign an appropriate creature) drawn by the summon swarm spell will viciously attack all creatures in a 10 ft by 10ft area chosen by the caster. Creatures actively defending against the swarm to the exclusion of other activities suffer 1 point of damage for each round spent in the swarm. Those taking other actions, including leaving the swarm, receive damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per three levels of the caster each round. Note that spellcasting within the swarm is impossible.\n\n\n\nDice Roll\nSwarm Type\n\n\n\n\n01-40\nRats\n\n\n41-70\nBats\n\n\n71-80\nSpiders\n\n\n81-90\nCentipedes/beetles\n\n\n91-100\nFlying insects\n\n\n\nThe swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and area effects can force it to disperse by inflicting damage. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. A Protection From Evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as Gust of Wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (for example, only flyers are affected by a Gust of Wind). The caster must remain stationary and undisturbed to control the swarm; if their concentration lapses or is broken, the swarm disperses in two rounds. The swarm is stationary once conjured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTongues\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell allows the creature touched to speak and understand any language or dialect. Only one language can be spoken at a time, but any number can be understood. This spell does not alter other creatures’ dispositions and does not allow the affected creature to speak to creatures that cannot understand language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarp Wood*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2, Druid 2\nRange: 50’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster causes non-magical wood in a 20 ft radius to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open or becomes stuck; a boat or ship springs a leak; warped weapons (like bows and arrows) are useless. The caster may warp wood object(s) up to 1 ft on all sides per caster level.\nAlternatively, the caster can “Un-Warp” non-magical wood (effectively warping it back to normal), straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. The caster can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or un-warp) an object that is too large to warp with a single spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Breathing\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 2\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThe affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’ per level\nMagic-User 2\nDuration: 2 turns/level\nWeb creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10’x10’x10’ cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.\nAnyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the DM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.\nIf the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.\nThe strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10’ cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10’ cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard Lock\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: 20’\nDuration: Permanent\nA Wizard Lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful Dispel Magic or Knock spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWraithform\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 2\nRange: Self\nDuration: 3 rounds/level\nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Undead of most sorts will ignore an individual in wraithform, believing him to be a wraith or spectre, though a lich or special undead may save vs. spell with a -4 penalty to recognize the spell.\nThe wizard can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all the caster wears or holds in their hands, as long as the spell persists. Note, however, that the caster cannot fly without additional magic. No form of attack is possible when in wraithform, except against creatures that exist on the Ethereal Plane, where all attacks (both ways) are normal. A successful Dispel Magic spell forces the wizard in wraithform back to normal form. The spellcaster can end the spell with a single word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarkskin\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 2, Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level\nWhen the Barkskin spell is cast upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 17, plus 1 AC for every two levels. Armor Class 18 at 4th level, Armor Class 19 at 6th, Armor Class 20 at 8th and so on.\nThis spell does not function in combination with normal armor or any magical protection. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature the caster touches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClairaudience\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic-User 3\nDuration: 12 turns\nThis spell enables the caster to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60’ away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClairvoyance\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic-User 3\nDuration: 12 turns\nThis spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60’ away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkvision\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThe subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60’ for the duration of the spell. See here for a description of Darkvision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster can use Dispel Magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.\nIf dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the Dispel Magic caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.\nSome spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by Bestow Curse (the reverse of Remove Curse) as well as by cursed items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrainblade\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell imbues an edged weapon with the ability to drain blood with each successful strike made against a living creature. When a living creature is hit by a drainbladed weapon, the target suffers 1 additional point of damage. If the wielder of the weapon is injured, the extra point of damage is transferred to them as healing energy. In no way can this healing energy grant more hit points than the wielder’s normal maximum.\nAgainst nonliving creatures, such as undead, golems, living statues, etc, this spell has no effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereal\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes the recipient to enter the ethereal plane. They become semi-transparent and immaterial. While in this state, magical weapons or weapons with certain special properties are necessary to strike the recipient. Any stealth checks such as Move Silently or Hide are made at +4, and the character may move through materials up to 1 inch thick per level of the caster. Some materials may prevent passage such as lead, gold, or other materials with special properties. While able to move through materials and effectively weightless, the ethereal being does not gain any other special movement modes like flying or levitation; walking upon materials such as water is possible though.\nThe ethereal character may not make physical attacks but may cast spells that do not require physical contact. While the spell is active, the individual may choose to revert back and forth between corporeal and incorporeal forms on their turn, remaining in the chosen state until their next turn.\nThere is a 10% chance (DC 2) that each turn that a creature is ethereal that they will draw the attention of a wraith (1) or ghost (2) that will immediately attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireball\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20’ radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure.\nThe caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.\nThe fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Gate\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Self and 50 yard/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nIn order for this spell to work, there need to be at least two large fires (a minimum of 2 to 4 ft in diameter) within range of each other. The maximum range was 50 yd/per level of the caster. If more than one such fire exists within range, then the caster can choose the destination. If no suitable destination is available, the spell fizzles and the caster is left standing in the fire.\nFire gate only transports the caster and what the caster is carrying and only provides temporary (1 round) of protection from the flames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaming Skull\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe Magic-User can throw a skull that ignites and detonates with a low roar and deals 6d6 points of fire damage within a spherical volume with a 20’ radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure. The flaming skull sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFly\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load.\nIf the spell duration expires while the subject is still airborne, the magic fails slowly such that the subject descends at a rate of 120 feet per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that time they land safely; if not, the subject falls the rest of the distance and suffers normal falling damage. However, if this spell is ended by Dispel Magic or similar outside forces, the subject falls immediately. For any such fall, see Falling Damage for details of the consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFossilize\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell permanently hardens the bones of one skeletal undead creature, making the bones denser and stronger. The fossilized skeleton permanently gets +2 on damage rolls, +4 on its AC, and its damage resistance is enhanced. A fossilized skeleton takes only quarter-damage from edged weapons, and half-damage from any other weapons. The fossilized skeleton becomes immune to normal arrows, bolts, and bullets. Magical missile weapons do only their ‘plus’ in damage.\nWhile this spell is permanent, there is a drawback. The newly fossilized skeleton may not be repaired or otherwise ‘healed’, as the organic materials that made up the bones has been completely replaced by minerals. Intelligent skeletal undead would not normally want this spell applied to themselves, but the spell would affect them nevertheless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaseous Form\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe subject of this spell and all of their gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. The caster becomes immune to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical weapons. The subject can’t attack or cast spells while in gaseous form. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form.\nA gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10’, and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the spell persists. The gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can’t enter water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the spell was cast. The subject can resume material form at will, but that will end the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrave Sanctuary\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nSimilar to the Druid spell Tree Sanctuary, this spell enables the caster to create an invisible entry into a grave, mausoleum, sarcophagus, large tombstone, or similar item associated with the repose of the dead. The entry is visible to undead and other Black Magic-Users, but this does not grant any special access to the doorway. Once the spell is complete, the Black Magic-User may enter the space, effectively disappearing from sight. Only one grave may be effected by grave sanctuary at a time.\nThe Black Magic-User is completely aware of their surroundings while in the grave, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the site. Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Black Magic-User rests inside the grave counts as a full hour of sleep, so the Black Magic-User may meditate to memorize spells while within the magical sanctuary. Also, if the grave site is on unhallowed ground or an area otherwise associated with hauntings and the like, then the Black Magic-User heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the grave.\nWhile inside the grave, the Black Magic-User does lose any sense of taste, smell, or touch, and may not speak or otherwise cast spells while inside the grave’s protection. If the grave itself is unearthed or broken into in some way, then the Black Magic-User takes 2d10 points of damage and is cast out into the nearest available space. This kind of undertaking should be roughly equivalent to actually digging a grave up, and not simply an attack against the earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGust of Wind\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 3\nRange: 10’ x 10 yds/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nWhen this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the caster and moves in the direction the caster is facing. The force of this Gust of Wind (about 30 m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames–such as those of lanterns–to dance wildly and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spellcaster to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind’s movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures.\nIts path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level wizard causes a Gust of Wind that travels 80 yards).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalt Undead\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 3\nRange: 200’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell will render up to three undead creatures immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to Hold person, but only affecting undead and potentially affecting more than one target). Intelligent undead get a save vs. Spells to avoid; unintelligent undead get no saving throw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaste*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: 30’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as normal, having double their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.\nReversed, haste becomes Slow; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and slow counter and dispel each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Person\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2, Magic-User 3\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.\nA winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisibility 10’ radius\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.\nThose affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves, but if the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible (including any previously affected creatures who have become visible as described above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunity to Normal Weapons\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level\nThis spell temporarily makes the target immune to non-magical weapons. Anyone affected by this spell is treated as an enchanted creature for the purpose of magic, which specifically affects them (for instance, a sword +1, +3 vs. enchanted creatures applies its special bonus to a creature protected by this magic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisibility 10’ Radius\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions like Invisibility, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.\nThose affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves, but if the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible (including any previously affected creatures who have become visible as described above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: 50’+10’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The bolt begins at the caster’s fingertips and extends to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5’ wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5’ wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so.\nThe lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the DM’s option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelf’s Minute Meteors\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: 70 yds. + 10 yds./level\nDuration: Special\nThis spell enables the wizard to cast small globes of fire (one for each experience level the caster has attained), each of which bursts into a 1-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4 points of damage to the creature struck. These can ignite combustible materials. The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenade like missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within 3 feet.\nThe spell can be cast in either of two ways:\n\nThe wizard discharges all meteors in one round.\nThe wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can also perform other actions in the round, including spell casting, melee, or device use. Additional spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles.\n\nThe spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as the caster has experience levels, when the caster forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisty Step\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe Magic User becomes surrounded by shimmering, silvery mist through which they can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that they can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Evil 10’ Radius*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions exactly as Protection From Evil, but with a 10’ radius rather than a 1’ radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.\nReversed, this spell becomes Protection From Good 10’ Radius, and functions exactly as the reversed form of Protection From Evil, except that it covers a 10’ radius around the target rather than the normal 1’ radius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Normal Missiles\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 3\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay of Exhaustion\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: 50’\nDuration: 6 rounds/level\nThe caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any dexterity bonus). If the narrow black ray hits, the target must save vs. Spells or suffer a -6 adjustment to its Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell. If the save is made, the reduction is only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpirit Wrack\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Special\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to any one particular incorporeal undead being such as wraiths, spectres, ghosts, or similar entities within sight of the caster. Alternatively, the caster may choose to cause a burst of 1d4 points of damage per level to any such beings within 20 feet of the caster, whether visible or not.\nMinor spiritual beings such as poltergeists haunting an area are usually destroyed outright by this spell. Any affected being is allowed a save for half damage. Some persistent types of undead may reform after the passage of some time (typically days later), and may require certain rituals or other requirements be fulfilled before being permanently destroyed. This spell only affects true incorporeal undead and does nothing against other types of beings, even if they happen to be insubstantial at the time; vampires that happen to be in gaseous form are immune to this spell’s effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummon Spirit\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: 10’/level\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nUpon casting this spell, a malevolent spirit in the form of a wraith is called to serve the caster for 1 turn per level. If the caster is 10th level the caster may choose between 1d4 wraiths or one spectre. At 15th level the caster may opt to summon 2d4 wraiths, 1d3 spectres, or one ghost. The summoned spirits will serve according to its ability, usually by combating the caster’s foes, and generally disappearing at the end of the spell’s duration.\nOccasionally the spirit does not depart at the end of the spell duration, but simply becomes free of the compulsion to serve and will usually attack the caster. The chance is 5% for any particular wraith, 10% for spectres, and 20% for a ghost. When this occurs, the spirit will remain in the area for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level before departing. A spirit with less than half its hit points will not stay regardless. The caster would be wise to have protections or other contingencies against the rogue spirits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVampiric Touch\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 3\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThe caster must make an attack roll. If successful, the caster deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. The caster gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. If the attack kills the target, the caster only gains as many temporary hit points as it took to kill the target, not the full number rolled. The temporary hit points will last for 1 hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigby’s Interposing Hand\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 10 yards/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThe Bigby’s Interposing Hand spell creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that appears between the spellcaster and their chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. Neither invisibility nor polymorph fools the hand once a creature has been chosen. The hand does not pursue an opponent.\nIt provides cover for the caster against the selected opponent, with all the attendant combat adjustments. It has as many hit points as the caster in full health and has an Armor Class of 15.\nAny creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal movement. If the original opponent is slain, the caster can designate a new opponent for the hand. The caster can command the hand out of existence at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Tentacles\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nA field of 10-foot-long rubbery tentacles will spring from the ground. The area is up to 30 feet by 30 feet, and they will appear from whatever surface is present, including water.\nThe tentacles will attack any creature in the area with the intent to wrestle/grapple them. They attack with the caster’s attack bonus and are considered to have a Strength of 18. There are more than enough tentacles to individually attack as many targets as can be present. If the attack succeeds, the target is held immobile and takes 1d6 points of damage each round it is held.\nAny creature that is not held by a tentacle may still only move through the affected area at half speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlink\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 round/level\nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes their material form to “blink” directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after the caster has blinked.\nEach round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink–the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard’s initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from their previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.\nDuring each round that the caster blinks, they can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.\nIf the spellcaster holds off their attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to their normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, the caster probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get their attack in before the caster blinks (the caster must announce their intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative).\nIn this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that their initiative roll is lower than their blink roll (the two rolls are not added if the caster is trying to attack before the caster blinks). If so, the caster attacks according to their initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If their blink roll is lower than their initiative roll, however, the caster blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction the caster’s facing (the caster must go through with their attack, even if the caster is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Monster\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell functions like Charm Person, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice. Saving throws are made just as for Charm Person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 2 rounds+1/level\nThis spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30’ radius circle around the target point to become confused,making them unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the following table on each subject’s Initiative number each round to see what the subject does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd20\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n1–2\nAttack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).\n\n\n3–4\nAct normally.\n\n\n5–10\nDo nothing but babble incoherently.\n\n\n11–14\nFlee away from caster at top possible speed.\n\n\n15–20\nAttack nearest creature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport {confusionTable, highlightTableRow} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof gemJewel3 = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: back; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#confusion-table\", confusionTable())})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorpse Feast\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: 5’/level\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell heals the caster and nearby active undead beings by draining the last energies from any fresh corpses (no more than an hour old) within the spell range. The corpse must have been a living sentient being (i.e. not animal, undead, construct, elemental, etc).\nAny corpse drained using this spell provides vigor to the caster and their active undead allies within range, healing 1d4 hit points per corpse, up to their maximum. Slain or destroyed undead do not heal or rise anew. Any corpses consumed by this spell cannot be raised or resurrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Scrying\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/leve1\nBy means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt to observe them by means of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, or Magic Mirror. This also reveals the use of Crystal Balls or other magical scrying devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to “sweep” areas for the duration of the spell.\nWhen a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the wizard who cast this spell immediately knows the identity and general location of the scryer. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, “The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,” or, “You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30 yards\nDuration: 1 rd/level\nA Dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.\nAny creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.\nThe spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension Door\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any single target creature within range, to any spot within 200’ plus 20’ per caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will be transported also, including another character or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivination\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis magic and an offering (such as tea leaves) puts the caster in contact with the pattern of the universe. This pattern can be deciphered to interpret dreams, predict the future, Identify a Magic Item, or to find hidden things.\nThe caster may ask a single question. The DM roles on the chart below and gives tan appropriate reply based on that role. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\n\n\n(1d20)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1-3 (15%)\nTotal Failure; no answer\n\n\n4-6 (15%)\nPartial Failure; Misleading answer\n\n\n7-13 (35%)\nPartial Success; Cryptic answer\n\n\n14-17 (20%)\nSuccess; Clear but Succinct answer\n\n\n18-20 (15%)\nComplete Success; Clear and Detailed answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnervation\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: 50’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any Dexterity bonus). If the narrow ray of crackling black energy hits, the target suffers 1d4 negative levels and all of the effects described in Energy Drain. There is no saving throw, only the attack roll.\nIf the target survives, it will lose the negative levels (i.e. regain their levels) after a number of hours equal to the caster’s level.\nAn undead creature struck by the ray gains 5d4 temporary hit points for one hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Special\nDuration: Special\nBy use of an extension spell, the wizard doubles the duration of a previously cast 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell. Naturally, the spell affects only spells that have durations.\nThis spell must be cast immediately after the spell to be extended, either by the original caster or another wizard. If a complete round or more elapses, the extension fails and is wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater Fear\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell sends an invisible wave of fear out forward of the caster to a range of 30 feet. Anyone in the area must save vs. Spells or be panicked. A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary. If cornered, the creature will cower in fear. The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws. The creature will do this for the duration of the spell. If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Plants*\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a 10’x100’ area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.\nThe reverse form, Shrink Plants, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version.\nGrowth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by Dispel Magic. This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallucinatory Terrain\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: 400’+40’/level\nDuration: 12 turns/level\nThis spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to cast.\nThe affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs. Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannelore’s Rope Trick\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 4 turns/level\nWhen this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space. The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them.\nThe rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM’s option). Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope. The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which they entered the extradimensional space.\nThe rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Also note that creating or taking extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 300’+30’/level\nDuration: 1 round\nThis spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1 full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a 20’ radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40’, so creatures higher than that distance above the target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its save).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllusionary Wall\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 30 yards\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is permanent until dispelled. The area of effect is 1 x 10 x 10 ft. It appears absolutely real when viewed (even magically, as with the priest spell True Seeing or its equivalent), but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, normal demihuman and magical detection abilities work normally, and touch or probing searches reveal the true nature of the surface, though they do not cause the illusion to disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved Invisibility\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level\nThis spell works exactly like Invisibility, except that it does not end if the subject attacks or casts a spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 4\nRange: 10’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nTurns a reflective surface within range into a magic mirror through which the caster can view other creatures. The caster must know and name the creature. The caster and any other creatures viewing the mirror will be able to see the images, but only the caster will hear sound from the viewing. Detection and vision spells can be cast into it with a 3% chance per caster level of success. If successful, this allows the caster to cast detect magic, see invisible, etc. through the mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassmorph\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nWith this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120’ radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself among the affected creatures.\nThose affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by Dispel Magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonster Summoning\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Special\nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level\nWithin one round of casting this spell, the wizard magically conjures monsters (see list below).\nThe monsters appear anywhere within the spell’s area of effect, as desired by the wizard. They attack the spell user’s opponents to the best of their ability until either the caster commands that the attacks cease, the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.\nThese creatures do not check morale, but they vanish when slain. Note that if no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if the wizard can communicate with them and if they are physically able, perform other services for the summoning wizard.\nIn rare cases, adventurers have been known to disappear, summoned by powerful spellcasters using this spell. Those summoned recall all the details of their trip.\n\n\n\nRoll\nMonster\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 Hell Hound\n\n\n2\n1d2 Giant Scorpions\n\n\n3\n2d4 Giant Centipedes\n\n\n4\n2d6 Hobgoblin Warriors\n\n\n5\n2d8 Skeletons\n\n\n6\n2d10 Goblins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMordenkainen’s Faithful Hound\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 10 yards/level\nDuration: Special\nBy means of this spell, the wizard summons up a phantom watchdog that only the caster can see. The caster may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real.\nIf the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymorph Other\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike Polymorph Self, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.\nThe target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.\nUnwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymorph Self\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than the caster’s level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her original form.\nThe caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the dragon’s normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon’s breath.\nThe caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she desires (up to one hour per level, of course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-Animation\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nVirtually identical to the Animate Dead spell, this spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The Black Magic-User may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to three times their caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly-intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly-intact corpse.\nThe caster must touch the remains to be animated. The caster may control no more hit dice of undead than 6 times their level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Curse*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3, Druid 3, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nRemove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.\nThe reverse of this spell, Bestow Curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:\n–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).\n–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.\nEach round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.\nThe caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a Remove Curse spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRot Flesh\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell works exactly like the Decay Flesh spell, save that it deals 2d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level to the creature affected by it. The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage. A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level have passed.\nJust like the lower level Decay Flesh spell, this spell may not be reversed, and similarly, this spell works upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed for 2d6 points plus 1 point per caster level worth of damage instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrink Item\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/12 of its normal size. Optionally, the caster can also change its now-shrunken composition to a cloth like one. An object in the possession of another creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Objects changed by an Shrink Item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original spellcaster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Bones\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 4\nRange: 10’/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nAn immobile wall of writhing interlocking bone and bone fragments rises from the earth. The wall is composed of up to one 10-foot x 10-foot square section, 1 foot thick, per caster level. Unlike the similar spell, Wall of Stone, the caster may not double the wall’s area by halving its thickness, as the structure is already very porous and would lose its structural integrity, but of course the wall can be made thicker. For instance, a 10th-level caster could conjure a section to fill in a 10-foot cube (10 feet x 10 feet x 1 foot, 10 sections thick). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall does not require concentration to maintain, but falls to pieces at the end of the spell duration.\nThe spell also differs from the Wall of Stone spell in that the semi-animated wall attacks those within close proximity to its structure (10 feet) for 2d4 piercing and slashing damage from the bones. The structure is not completely solid, so high-strength individuals may attempt to break through with a Strength check, but they take an additional 2d6+1/level points of damage while making the attempt for each 1 foot of thickness that they attempt to move through. A separate Strength check is necessary for each 1 foot of thickness of the wall section in order to break through. The bone wall does not attack the caster or any undead creatures. The Wall of Bones may be fashioned into simple structures such as ramps or bridges to span a rift, but these uses reduce the size by half so that supporting arches or buttresses can be included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 1 round/level (or special)\nAn immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster’s turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.\nThe wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).\nIf the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard Eye\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 4\nRange: 240’\nDuration: 6 turns\nWith this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye” through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240’ away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40’ per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240’ feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human’s eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nThis spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlight\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell withers a single plant of any size. It causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to the touched plant creature. The creature is allowed a save vs. Spells for half damage. If the plant is not a creature, it immediately withers and dies with no saving throw.\nOnly the touched plant is affected; the spell has no effect on anything else in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudkill\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nDuration: 6 rounds/level\nThis spell creates a 20’x20’x20’ cloud of poison gas which moves at a rate of 10’ per round under the control of the caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjure Elemental\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 240’\nDuration: Special\nA portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only Dispel Magic or Dispel Evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignor’s Wind Mastery\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 0’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster alters wind force around them (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high). The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration. The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to 40 ft radius around them and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than their full limit.\nThe caster may choose wind patterns over the spell’s area. The caster can choose a downdraft blows from the center outward, an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.\nFor every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlame Strike\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Instantaneoous\nA Flame Strike produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high). The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeblemind*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nMagic-User 5\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell allows the caster to inflict a terrible curse on a living creature, reducing both Intelligence and Charisma to just 1 point each. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist this effect, but if the target creature is a spellcaster a penalty of -4 is applied to the saving throw.\nOnce feebleminded, the victim of this spell can no longer cast spells, speak or understand any language, or indeed communicate at all as their mind can no longer understand even such simple things as pointing or beckoning. The victim still knows their friends and allies and will follow them and try to help or protect them.\nThis effect can be removed with a Heal spell, or with the reversed form of this spell Restoremind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Monster\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell functions like Hold Person, except that it affects any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLusian’s Terrible Transmutation\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 5\nRange: 20’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell fused two different creatures into a single unique form, combining traits of both into the new form. This spell often does not function, and kills, creatures that possessed any magical abilities.\nBoth creatures needed to be within 20 feet of each other when the spell is cast and the new creature would appear where the larger creature was. Both creatures are allowed a Saving throw. Any save negates the spell. A failed save rolls on the result table.\n\n\n\nRoll\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1-5\nTotal Failure resulting in death.\n\n\n6-11\nTotal Failure with minor consequences.\n\n\n12-14\nTotal Failure with minor consequences.\n\n\n15-17\nPartial Success with minor consequences\n\n\n18-20\nSuccessful fusion as planned.\n\n\n\nCreatures possessing intelligence higher than that of an animal are likely to have their mind shattered during the casting (DC 15), resulting in an uncontrollable wild creation.\nThe resulting creature is likely not able to breed successfully unless Lusian’s Join Animal was sealed with a permanency spell.\nHistory:\nThis spell was developed by Lusian the Transmuter, a powerful elven sorceress in the black arts from Imladris. Lusian called forth dark powers with binding rituals. She perverted nature – forging blood and sinew, forcing hoof and beak to meld as one, grafting wing with claw and fang to feather. So wicked was she that the goddess Ki bound her to a horrible fate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Jar\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Special\nBy casting Magic Jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar), leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when the caster’s soul returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.\nTo cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her soul upon casting, the caster’s body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.\nPossession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by Protection From Evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host leaves the caster’s life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell.\nIf the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.\nIf the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by Dispel Magic or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the caster’s body, the caster’s spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster’s spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.\nIf the caster’s spirit is driven from the host body by Dispel Evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit returns to the jar, and the host’s spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host’s body dies.\nIf the host’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host’s body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host’s spirit departs, and the caster’s spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel Evil can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell.\nIn any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMask of Life\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell makes a single undead creature appear to be alive. The caster can decide which race and style of clothes is worn by the undead creature. The spell will also make the target’s movements appear life-like. The illusion will create appropriate ambient effects (smells, sounds, clothing textures, and such) that would be expected for the life-like appearance.\nIf the appearance is that of a living version of the target, anyone interacting with the target takes a -5 penalty to any saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the target attacks or does anything that only the undead creature could do, the penalty is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPasswall\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 3 turns\nPasswall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, Dispel Magic, or caster’s choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Sanctum\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 24 hours\nThis spell creates a field impenetrable to most kinds of scrutiny. Those looking into the area from outside see only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. Eavesdroppers do not perceive any sound, no matter how loud, emanating from the area. Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally. Anyone inside the affected area is immune to ESP spells.\nDivination spells like Magic Mirror, Clairvoyance, and Clairaudience cannot perceive anything within the area.\nNo speech is possible between those inside and those outside the sanctum. The spell does not prevent other means of communication, such as telepathic communication, or such as that between a Magic-User and a familiar.\nPrivate sanctum does not stop creatures from moving into and out of the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock to Mud*\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 150’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud; up to two 10 ft cubes per caster level may be so transformed. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 ft. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 ft and causing it to suffer a ‑2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and armor class. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 ft., suffering none of the other penalties given.\nIf rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool to a depth of 5 ft. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.\nCastles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since Rock to Mud cannot affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such a buildings’ foundation. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.\nThe mud remains until a successful Dispel Magic or Mud to Rock spell restores its substance (though not necessarily its form). Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.\nWhen using the reverse, Mud to Rock, the spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently. Any creature in the mud must save vs. Death Ray to escape before the area transforms into rock (assuming it has enough movement to do so).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoneskin\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nProtects the caster. The caster’s skin becomes hard and stone-like, protecting the caster by absorbing the first 10 points/level of damage from all attacks. (This operates like hardness.) Once the spell has absorbed 10 points of damage per caster level, the spell is discharged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol of Pain\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 5\nRange: Special\nDuration: Special\nWith this spell, the caster writes a potent rune on a surface. When triggered each creature within 60 feet of the Symbol of Pain are wracked with pain. This pain imposes a -4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. These effects last for as long as the creature stays within range of the symbol, and for 1 hour after leaving the area.\nOnce triggered, the symbol will remain active for 1 turn per caster level. After that the symbol is discharged. A symbol is permanent until discharged; it may be removed by Dispel Magic that targets the rune specifically.\nThe symbol is triggered by one or more of the following, as determined by the caster: a victim looks at the rune, reads the rune, touches the rune, or passes near the rune. Regardless of the triggering methods, it cannot be triggered by a creature more than 60 feet away. Once the spell is cast, the trigger methods cannot be changed.\nTriggering methods can be further modified by qualifiers, type of creature, race of creature, number of creatures, skip some number of triggers (so it is the third creature to touch it, not the first or second), or any other qualifier that is based on observable actions or details.\nThe symbol may also be assigned a password that will temporarily disable the symbol when the password is said as a creature enters the range of the symbol. Each time the range is entered, the password must be said again or the symbol will go off. This is set at the time of casting and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelekinesis\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: Self\nDuration: 3 turns\nThis spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In order to use this power, the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeleport\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 5\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell instantly transports the caster to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature’s possession from being teleported.\nThe caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\nTo determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table below. Below the table is an explanation of the terms used.\n\n\n\nFamiliarity\nOn Target\nOff Target\nSimilar Area\nMishap\n\n\n\n\nVery familiar\n01–97\n98–99\n100\n–\n\n\nStudied carefully\n01–94\n95–97\n98–99\n100\n\n\nSeen casually\n01–88\n89–94\n95–98\n99–100\n\n\nViewed once\n01–76\n77–88\n89–96\n97–100\n\n\nFalse destination\n–\n–\n81–92\n93–100\n\n\n\nFamiliarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic.\n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.\nOn Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.\nOff Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\nSimilar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.\nMishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 5, Druid 5, Magic-User 5\nRange: 15’ per level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, 1’ thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\nThe caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or she desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a Disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaves of Fatigue\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 5\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell sends an invisible wave of harmful energy out forward of the caster to a range of 30 feet. All living creatures in the area suffer a -2 adjustment to their Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Magic Shell\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Druid 7, Magic-user 6\nRange: 10’ Radius\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nWithin a 10’ radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigby’s Forceful Hand\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 6\nRange: 10 yards/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nBigby’s Forceful Hand is a more powerful version of Bigby’s Interposing Hand. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. However, the forceful hand also pushes on the opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs more than 2,000 pounds.\nA creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage. The forceful hand has an Armor Class of 18, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to release a trapped opponent, for example) or dismiss it on command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Undead\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6, Black Magic-User 6\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 6 round/level\nThis spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time. Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used. If communication is not possible, they will still not attack. Intelligent undead creatures may save vs. Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled. Unintelligent undead do not get a saving throw and the control is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the caster’s total control limit Re-animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Spell\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 240’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a 30’ radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension Door\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 10’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any single target creature within range, to any spot within 200’ plus 20’ per caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and distance.\nAn unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will be transported also, including another character or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisintegrate\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 60’\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster’s pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a 10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.\nA creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is unaffected. The ray can target only one creature per casting, if that target saves, the spell is wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEyebite\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 6\nRange: 60’\nDuration: 1 round/3 levels\nEach round the caster may target a single living creature for the duration of the spell. The affected creature suffers effects depending on its total hit dice. If the target has 10 HD or more, it is sickened. If the target has 5 HD through 9 HD, it is panicked and sickened. If the target has 4 HD or fewer, it is comatose, panicked, and sickened. The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Targeting each additional creature after the first requires an action, and only one may be targeted in a given round.\nThe target must save vs. Death Ray to avoid the worst effect of the spell. If the target is affected by more than one effect, the remaining effects are still present.\nIf a creature is sickened, it suffers from a -2 modifier for attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\nIf a creature is panicked, it will flee for 1d4 rounds. After that, the victim will flee again for 1d4 rounds if it can still see the caster. Even after the fleeing ends, the creature is still affected by the sickening as described above.\nIf a creature is comatose, it falls into a coma for 1 turn per caster level. During this time, the victim cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. Even if the coma is dispelled, the creature is still subject to fleeing if the caster is visible, and is still sickened. This is not a sleep effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlesh to Stone*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 30’/level\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear, to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs. Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.\nThe reverse spell, Stone to Flesh, acts as a counterspell for Flesh to Stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not the result of Flesh to Stone or similar petrification effects (such as a medusa’s gaze).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGishigan’s Geas*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 5’ per level\nDuration: Special\nGishigan’s Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.\nA saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.\nThe geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.\nIf the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the DM’s discretion.\nFor every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.\nA geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a [Remove] Curse(allSpells.html#remove-curse) spell, or by a Wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel Magic does not affect a geas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Plants*\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 6\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a 10’x100’ area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.\nThe reverse form, Shrink Plants, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version.\nGrowth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by Dispel Magic. This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisible Stalker\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 0\nDuration: Special\nThe caster summons an Invisible Stalker to do his or her bidding (see the Monsters section, below, for details). The spell persists until Dispel Evil is cast on the creature, it is slain, or the task is fulfilled. The DM is advised to review the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is used, as they may not always be reliable servants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Water\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 4, Magic-User 6\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a Slow spell (the reverse of Haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMummify\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 6\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nAfter careful ceremonial preparations lasting five days, and the application of many rare and expensive unguents, the caster is able to call back the spirit of the dead to reanimate its corpse as a mummy. Mummies so created are of the standard sort (see its monster entry). Mummies do not count against the normal limits of controllable undead (per Re-animation spell), but the caster can maintain control over as many Hit Dice of mummies as their own level.\nMummies do not travel well, being slow and quickly wear down, taking damage on long journeys. They make better guardians for the animator’s lair. A separate casting of the spell is necessary for each mummy created. It might be possible to create a mummy from a large humanoid such as a giant, however the difficulty will be greater (the DM determines how much more difficult). More powerful mummies, such as those with intact class-based powers, are generally created through the use of the undeath spell.\nMummification is generally in the realm of the Black Magic-User, but occasionally Clerics of certain cults might have access as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermanency\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’\nMagic-User 6\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell is used to make another spell of 6th or lower level permanent. Only arcane magic can be affected: Clerical, Druidic, and other spells of divine nature can not be made permanent. No spell with a permanent or instantaneous duration can be made permanent.\nA permanency spell lasts until dispelled. When it is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Casting a permanency spell causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution. Lost Constitution is recovered using the Constitution Point Losses rules.\nNo more than two spells can be made permanent on a single person, item or place. If a third Permanency spell is cast it automatically fails, and there is a 50% that each of the two other permanency spells fails too.\nA Permanency spell is not necessary to make any magical item; using permanency to bind a spell to an object, person, or place is not the same as crafting a magic item.\nSpells that are commonly made permanent on a creature: Detect Magic, Protection From Evil, Read Languages, Read Magic, Tongues, Detect Invisible, and Fly.\nSpells commonly made permanent on items or locations include: Alarm, Animate Objects, Confusion, Dancing Lights, guards and wards, Invisibility, Phantasmal Force, Private Sanctum, Magic Mouth, Symbol of Pain,Wall of Fire, and Web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n## Projected Image\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 240’\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight between the caster and his or her illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Dimension Door, Teleport, or any similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can’t directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster’s actual position, not the illusory self’s position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReincarnate\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6, Magic-user 6\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nRoll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes:\n\n\n\nd%\nIncarnation\n\n\n\n\n01–02\nBugbear\n\n\n03–17\nDwarf\n\n\n18–28\nElf\n\n\n29\nGnoll\n\n\n30–39\nGnome\n\n\n40–44\nGoblin\n\n\n45–63\nHalfling\n\n\n64–88\nHuman\n\n\n89–92\nKobold\n\n\n93\nLizard Man\n\n\n94–98\nOrc\n\n\n99\nTroglodyte\n\n\n100\nOther (DM’s choice)\n\n\n\nSince the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\nA reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the DM as needed.) The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character’s original hit point total; this is the new form’s hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.\nA character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReveal Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: 5’\nDuration: 1 minute\nThis spell reveals all spell and magical properties of an object, creature, or permanently enchanted area examined with this spell. The caster must examine the object, creature, or location for an entire minute. In the case of a magic item, the caster will learn all of its functions, how to activate it (if required), and any charges left (if it has charges). If it is an object or creature with spells cast on it, or an enchanted area, the caster will learn what spells, their effects, and the caster level of those spells.\nAny object or magic item that is held by someone who does not want the object or magic item examine may negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells. Likewise a creature that does not want to be examined may also negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Walk\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 6\nRange: Touch (see text)\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nShadow Walk can only be cast in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and up to one willing creature per level are transported to the ethereal plane. In this region of shadow, the caster (and all the creatures that accompany them) moves at an effective rate of 50 miles per hour.\nBecause of the blurring of reality, the caster can’t make out details of the terrain or areas the caster passes over during transit, nor can the caster predict perfectly where the travel will end. When the spell effect ends, the caster and any creatures accompanying them arrives 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint.\nThe caster and their companions always arrive at ground level, except if the landing area is in a body of water (in which case they arrive at the water level) or underground. If arriving underground, the altitude of arrival should be as close as possible to the same altitude as the intended endpoint location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol of Fear\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-User 6\nRange: Special\nDuration: Special\nThis spell functions like Symbol of Pain, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the Symbol of Fear become panicked for 1 round per caster level. A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary. If cornered, the creature will cower in fear. The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws. The creature will do this for the duration of the spell. If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Iron\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 90’\nMagic-User 6\nDuration: Permanent\nThis spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.\nThe caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.\nLike any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Summoning\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 6, Magic-User 6\nRange: 10 miles\nDuration: 2 turn/level\nThe caster is able to summon nearby weather conditions. The caster must be aware of the weather condition to summon it. This spell does not grant control of the weather to the caster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 7, Magic-User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstral Projection\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Magic-user 7\nRange: Self\nDuration: Special\nThis spell frees the caster’s spirit (or soul) from their body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.\nThe participants’ spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants’ original bodies in suspended animation.\nThis spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or the caster’s new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants’ spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.\nUnlike Gate, the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, astral projection cannot be cast while still in the new body. To go to a different plane, the caster must end the spell, bringing everyone back to their original bodies and cast a new spell from their original bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigby’s Grasping Hand\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 7\nRange: 10 yards/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nBigby’s Grasping Hand is a superior version of the 6th-level spell Bigby’s Forceful Hand. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that appears and grasps a creature designated by the caster, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to escape it. The grasping hand can hold motionless a creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds weight, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 1,000 and 4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds.\nThe hand itself inflicts no damage. The grasping hand has an Armor Class of 18, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster can order it to release a trapped opponent or can dismiss it on command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 7\nRange: 100’ + 10’/level\nDuration: Special\nThis spell creates a small glowing bead at any location chosen by the caster, up to the listed range. This bead will explode in an improved form of fireball at a time chosen by the caster; when it explodes, it will do 1d6+1 points of damage per caster level to all within a spherical volume with a 20’ radius, just as with the standard fireball spell. The bead may explode immediately if the caster so desires, or may be delayed up to 10 rounds; the caster chooses the time when the spell is cast, and cannot subsequently be changed.\nIf a delay is chosen, the glowing bead lies at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead (with the same range as a dagger); if the bead is handled within 1 round of its scheduled detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates instantly, i.e. before it can be thrown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawmij’s Instant Summons\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-user 7\nRange: Infinite + special\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWhen this spell is cast, the magic-user teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to their hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving. The desired item is then transported instantly into the Magic-User’s hand. The item must have been previously touched and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinger of Death\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic-user 7\nRange: 25’ + 5’/2 levels\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThe Finger of Death spell snuffs out the victim’s life force. If successful, the victim can be neither raised nor resurrected. In addition, in human subjects the spell initiates changes to the body such that after three days the caster can, by means of a special ceremony costing not less than 1,000 gp plus 500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a juju zombie under the control of the caster. The changes can be reversed before animation by a Limited Wish or similar spell cast directly upon the body, and a full Wish restores the subject to life.\nThe caster utters the Finger of Death spell incantation, points their index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death occurs. A creature successfully saving still receives 2d8+1 points of damage. If the subject dies of damage, no internal changes occur and the victim can then be revived normally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 7, Magic-User 7\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster’s location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.\nThe gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster’s choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility.\nThe gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell’s duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.\nNote that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.\nAs long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the DM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater Teleport\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: Self\nDuration: Instanteous\nThis spell functions in a similar fashion to the normal Teleport spell, except that there is no limit to the range that can be spanned, nor is there any chance of arriving off target. In addition, the caster need not have seen the destination, if the caster has at least a reliable description of it. If the caster attempts to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), the caster disappears and then reappears in the original location. This spell cannot transport the caster to another plane of existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass Invisibility\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 240’\nDuration: Special\nThis spell bestows the effect of an Invisibility spell on all creatures within a 30’ by 30’ area, exactly as if each such creature had received its own spell; thus, each subject will remain invisible until the caster attacks or casts a spell, and will remain invisible after leaving the area of effect. As with the normal invisibility spell, this spell lasts at most 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteor Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 1 mile\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBlazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a saving throw vs. Spells. The sphere spreads around corners. Any affected creature takes 15d6 fire and bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.\nThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMordenkainen’s Sword\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 30’\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as the caster desires, beginning in the round that the spell is cast. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on the caster’s normal initiative turn. The sword attacks as a fighter of the same level as the caster, and the attack roll is modified by the caster’s Intelligence bonus. The sword inflicts 3d4 points of damage on a successful hit, and can hit even creatures immune to non-magical weapons. On a natural roll of 19 or 20, it will automatically hit its target, no matter its armor class. The sword can only be destroyed by a successful application of Dispel Magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase Door\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: 1 usage/2 levels\nThis spell creates a magical passage through a wall, the floor, the ceiling, or even through a section of ground. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the caster, who is the only one that can use the passage. The passage is 10 feet deep plus another 5 feet for every three caster levels.\nThe caster disappears when entering the phase door and appears when the caster exits. If desired, the caster can take one other creature through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor it is possible to see through it without using it.\nA phase door is subject to Dispel Magic, but only from someone who is of higher level than the caster. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, the caster is harmlessly ejected (determine randomly in which direction).\nIt is possible to allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting a triggering condition for the door. This condition can be as simple or elaborate as desired. It can be based on a creature’s name or identity, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Word Stun\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 120’\nDuration: Variable\nThe caster utters a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of their choice to become stunned, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target’s current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 71 or more hit points is unaffected by power word stun. If the target has between 36 and 70 hit points, the duration is 1d6 rounds. If the target has 35 hit points or less, the duration is 2d6 turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse Gravity\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid 7, Magic-User 7\nRange: 5 yds/level\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell reverses gravity in a 30’ x 30’ area of effect, causing all unattached objects and creatures within it to “fall” upward. The reverse gravity lasts as long as the caster desires or until the spell expires. If some solid object is encountered in this “fall,” the object strikes it in the same manner as it would during a normal downward fall. At the end of the spell duration, the affected objects and creatures fall downward. As the spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, or even thousands of feet in the air above the area can be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Turning\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 0’\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis abjuration reflects 3rd Level or lower spells back at the caster.\nIf it is Casting a Spell of 4th Level or higher, the Magic-User makes a DC check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level – Int bonus. On a success, the spell is reflected.\nSpell turning can’t affect spells that aren’t targeted (such as area spells). If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who is also under the effect of spell turning, their spell turning can attempt to reflect their own spell back at you again; if they do so, their counteract attempt automatically succeeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSympathy*\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: One location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThe Sympathy spell causes an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.\nCreatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.\nThe reverse spell Anitpathy causes an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.\nCreatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.\nA compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature’s Dexterity score by 4 points.\nSympathy counters and dispels Antipathy and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSympathy counters and dispels Antipathy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrap the Soul\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 10 yards\nDuration: Permanent until broken\nThis spell forces the creature’s life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.\nThe spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature’s real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.\nThe second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A Sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.\nThe gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.\nBefore the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanish\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nWhen the wizard employs this spell, the caster causes an object to vanish (i.e., to be teleported as if by a Teleport spell) if it weighs no more than 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a 14th-level caster can vanish, and cause to reappear at a desired location, an object up to 700 pounds in weight. The maximum volume of material that can be affected is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus, both weight and volume limit the spell. An object that exceeds either limitation is unaffected and the spell fails.\nIf desired, a vanished object can be placed deep within the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object vanished remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the point will bring the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane. Note that creatures and magical forces cannot be made to vanish.\nThere is a 1% chance that a vanished item will be disintegrated instead. There is also a 1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal Plane is able to gain access to the Prime Material Plane through the vanished item’s connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Force\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 180’\nDuration: 1 round/level (or special)\nThis spell creates an invisible wall of force up to 100 feet square. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks the surface, the spell fails. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including Dispel Magic. Dimension Door, Misty Step and Teleport can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at their option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWychlamp Aura\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic-User 7\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster of this spell will be sheathed in a pale, glowing aura which confers the effect of an Anti-Magic Shell (as the spell). In addition, any magic cast upon or including the caster in its area of effect is affected as follows:\nSpells directly targeting the caster (like Magic Missile) will be deflected. Roll 1d6; on 1-2, the magic is reflected back at the offending caster. Otherwise, it is deflected at a random target.\nArea effect magic is altered as follows (roll 1d10):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n1-2\nArea of effect is doubled and damage is halved (if applicable).\n\n\n3-4\nTarget point of the spell may be redetermined by the protected magic-user.\n\n\n5\nComplete nullification of the incoming spell.\n\n\n6\nThe incoming spell is unaffected.\n\n\n7-8\nSpell is randomly targeted as a grenade-like missile using the target point as the center.\n\n\n9-10\nArea of effect is halved and damage is doubled (if applicable).\n\n\n\nMagical attacks delivered by touch are always reflected back on the attacker.",

    "text": "Blink\nMagic-User 4\nRange: Self\nDuration: 1 round/level\nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes their material form to “blink” directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after the caster has blinked.\nEach round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink–the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard’s initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from their previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.\nDuring each round that the caster blinks, they can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.\nIf the spellcaster holds off their attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to their normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, the caster probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get their attack in before the caster blinks (the caster must announce their intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative).\nIn this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that their initiative roll is lower than their blink roll (the two rolls are not added if the caster is trying to attack before the caster blinks). If so, the caster attacks according to their initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If their blink roll is lower than their initiative roll, however, the caster blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction the caster’s facing (the caster must go through with their attack, even if the caster is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).",

At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only Dispel Magic or Dispel Evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.",

This also reveals the use of Crystal Balls or other magical scrying devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to “sweep” areas for the duration of the spell.\nWhen a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the wizard who cast this spell immediately knows the identity and general location of the scryer. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, “The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,” or, “You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.”",

However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.\nThe amount of information revealed depends on how long the Druid studies a particular area.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards.\n2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside the Druid’s line of sight, then the caster discern its direction but not its exact location.\nEach Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by the caster.\n\nEach round, the Druid can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area.

    "text": "Dig\nDruid 5, Magic-User 4\nRange: 30 yards\nDuration: 1 rd/level\nA Dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.\nAny creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.\nThe spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.",

The effect lasts for one round, during which creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area.

Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.\n• Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.\n• Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures in the area have a 1 in 4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.\n• Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring hardness.

It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the magic-user, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight will increase cubicly.\nAll equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials–the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.\nMagical properties are not increased by this spell–a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.\nFor example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with their long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.\nThe reverse spell, Reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch–the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.\nFor example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level magic-user (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.",

If the target has 4 HD or fewer, it is comatose, panicked, and sickened. The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Targeting each additional creature after the first requires an action, and only one may be targeted in a given round.\nThe target must save vs. Death Ray to avoid the worst effect of the spell. If the target is affected by more than one effect, the remaining effects are still present.\nIf a creature is sickened, it suffers from a -2 modifier for attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\nIf a creature is panicked, it will flee for 1d4 rounds. After that, the victim will flee again for 1d4 rounds if it can still see the caster. Even after the fleeing ends, the creature is still affected by the sickening as described above.\nIf a creature is comatose, it falls into a coma for 1 turn per caster level. During this time, the victim cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. Even if the comma is dispelled, the creature is still subject to fleeing if the caster is visible, and is still sickened. This is not a sleep effect.",

Those that walk into the circle (about 5 foot diameter) are transported into a region that borders the FeyWild (another plane of existence). This region can be utilized as a safe place to rest and recuperate (at double normal rate for purpose of healing and restoration of spells). From this border region, one may pass back into the familiar prime world or they might travel to the actual FeyWild.\nThe Feywild is the Plane of Faeries and it intersects with the OnceWas. The FeyWild is an echo of the real world but suffused with potent magic and unrestrained emotions. As an echo of OnceWas, its geography is similar although not entirely identical. The landscape is markedly more dramatic and beautiful with more trees and flowers. The mountains stand straighter and sharper. The rivers flow clearer and faster, the flowers bloom brighter and more fragrantly, and the weather manifests in supernatural ways.\nTime does not flow the same in the Feywild as it does in the OnceWas. While any visitor would experience time flowing as normal, it is often the case that more time was passing in the real world, sometimes on the order of weeks, months, or years longer than expected.\nMore concerning, leaving the Feywild can have dire consequences. Lost time could suddenly “catch up” to a mortal, sending them into fits of exhaustion or hunger, or even killing them instantly if many years had passed. Often, memories of time spent in the Feywild become hazy and dreamlike, if not vanishing altogether.\nIt is said to be the place from where the first elves originated.\nKi, goddess of life and nature and Queen of faeries, is known to spend time in the FeyWild when not in Elysium or in the OnceWas.",

The spell requires 10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier. The creature must be present, and the caster must touch it to cast the spell.\nOnly normal (non-magical) creatures of 1-1 hit die may be made into familiars. Further, each spellcaster may have only one familiar at a time. If a familiar dies, the caster will not be able to successfully cast this spell again for 2d6 months (the period to be rolled by the DM and not revealed to the player). A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist, and if this roll succeeds, the animal chosen is not compatible with the caster and cannot become their familiar.\nThe familiar will behave as if permanently charmed by its master and will perform any task assigned to it to the best of its ability. The creature’s morale is increased by 2 points (to a maximum of 11), and it receives improved intelligence equal to 3+1d4 points. Familiars also age at half the normal rate for their kind, so a cat familiar (for instance) might easily live forty years.\nThe familiar’s hit points are added to the Magic User ’s. If a familiar is slain, the Magic User loses double the familiar’s hit points, permanently.\nIn combat, it shares initiative and acts at the end of the Magic User’s turn.\nWithin 200 feet, the Magic User can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears, returning to the Magic User’s senses at will. During this time, the Magic User is deaf and blind regarding their own senses.\nAdditionally, while the familiar is within 100 feet of the Magic User, they can communicate telepathically. This communication is in simple telepathic concepts, such as “3 angry people. One is short” or “path forks, 3 ways ahead, smells like food”. Not enough detail for a map.",

This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.\nThe gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster’s choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility.\nThe gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell’s duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.\nNote that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.\nAs long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the DM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it.",

The entry is visible to undead and other Black Magic-Users, but this does not grant any special access to the doorway. Once the spell is complete, the Black Magic-User may enter the space, effectively disappearing from sight. Only one grave may be effected by grave sanctuary at a time.\nThe Black Magic-User is completely aware of their surroundings while in the grave, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the site. Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Black Magic-User rests inside the grave counts as a full hour of sleep, so the Black Magic-User may meditate to memorize spells while within the magical sanctuary. Also, if the grave site is on unhallowed ground or an area otherwise associated with hauntings and the like, then the Black Magic-User heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the grave.\nWhile inside the grave, the Black Magic-User does lose any sense of taste, smell, or touch, and may not speak or otherwise cast spells while inside the grave’s protection. If the grave itself is unearthed or broken into in some way, then the Black Magic-User takes 2d10 points of damage and is cast out into the nearest available space.

The images move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and remain in a cluster around them.

Figments always look exactly like the caster.\nEnemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was.",

In either case, the spell ends.\nIf the caster’s spirit is driven from the host body by Dispel Evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit returns to the jar, and the host’s spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host’s body dies.\nIf the host’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host’s body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host’s spirit departs, and the caster’s spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel Evil can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell.\nIn any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.",

The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long, can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the caster’s, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster’s command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb.\nThe range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.",

The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\nA reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the DM as needed.) The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character’s original hit point total; this is the new form’s hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.\nA character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.",

A symbol is permanent until discharged; it may be removed by Dispel Magic that targets the rune specifically.\nThe symbol is triggered by one or more of the following, as determined by the caster: a victim looks at the rune, reads the rune, touches the rune, or passes near the rune. Regardless of the triggering methods, it cannot be triggered by a creature more than 60 feet away. Once the spell is cast, the trigger methods cannot be changed.\nTriggering methods can be further modified by qualifiers, type of creature, race of creature, number of creatures, skip some number of triggers (so it is the third creature to touch it, not the first or second), or any other qualifier that is based on observable actions or details.\nThe symbol may also be assigned a password that will temporarily disable the symbol when the password is said as a creature enters the range of the symbol. Each time the range is entered, the password must be said again or the symbol will go off. This is set at the time of casting and cannot be changed.",

Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature’s possession from being teleported.\nThe caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\nTo determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table below.

When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.\nOn Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.\nOff Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\nSimilar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.\nMishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.",

    "text": "Trap the Soul\nMagic-User 7\nRange: 10 yards\nDuration: Permanent until broken\nThis spell forces the creature’s life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.\nThe spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature’s real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.\nThe second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A Sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.\nThe gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.\nBefore the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force.",

The wall is composed of up to one 10-foot x 10-foot square section, 1 foot thick, per caster level. Unlike the similar spell, Wall of Stone, the caster may not double the wall’s area by halving its thickness, as the structure is already very porous and would lose its structural integrity, but of course the wall can be made thicker. For instance, a 10th-level caster could conjure a section to fill in a 10-foot cube (10 feet x 10 feet x 1 foot, 10 sections thick). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall does not require concentration to maintain, but falls to pieces at the end of the spell duration.\nThe spell also differs from the Wall of Stone spell in that the semi-animated wall attacks those within close proximity to its structure (10 feet) for 2d4 piercing and slashing damage from the bones. The structure is not completely solid, so high-strength individuals may attempt to break through with a Strength check, but they take an additional 2d6+1/level points of damage while making the attempt for each 1 foot of thickness that they attempt to move through. A separate Strength check is necessary for each 1 foot of thickness of the wall section in order to break through. The bone wall does not attack the caster or any undead creatures.

If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.\nThe caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added).

The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.\nAnyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the DM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.\nIf the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.\nThe strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10’ cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10’ cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.",

    "text": "Dungeon Survival\nAs described in the Equipment section, normal characters must consume one day’s worth of rations (or equivalent food) and at least one quart of water per day.\nFailure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1 hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.\nInadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single day without adequate water, the character loses 1d4 hit points, and will lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter; healing ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled.\n\n\nTime and Scale\nTime is measured with a certain level of abstraction. Each Round of combat is comprised of a set of actions, which take place based on the initiative. For example, one attack roll may represent a whole series of feints, parries, and lunges.\nEach Action is approximately 10 seconds long. The order a character’s action takes place in is determined by initiative.\nA full combat Round (the entire initiative order) is approximately 1 minute and includes all actions (6).\nA Turn is approximately 10 minutes (10 full combat Rounds or 60 initiative Actions).\nDistances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so 100’ becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.\n\n\nCarrying Capacity\nPlayer characters with average strength are able to carry up to 40 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded, or up to 115 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. Note a character’s armor weight counts against their load.\n\n\n\nTable 15.1: Player Character Carrying Capacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength\nLight Load\nMedium Load\nHeavy Load\n\n\n\n\n3\n15 lbs.\n20 lbs.\n40 lbs.\n\n\n4-5\n15 lbs.\n30 lbs.\n50 lbs.\n\n\n6-8\n25 lbs.\n50 lbs.\n70 lbs.\n\n\n9-12\n40 lbs.\n75 lbs.\n115 lbs.\n\n\n13-15\n60 lbs.\n115 lbs.\n175 lbs.\n\n\n16-17\n75 lbs.\n150 lbs.\n250 lbs.\n\n\n18\n90 lbs.\n200 lbs.\n300 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are given in the Monsters section.\n\n\nMovement and Encumbrance\nThe movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player character races can all move 50’ per round. When exploring a dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.\nThis may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters (though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.\nA character’s movement rate is adjusted by his or her Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 15.2: Player Character Movement Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace\nLight Load\nMedium Load\nHeavy Load\n\n\n\n\nDwarf\n40’\n30’\n20’\n\n\nElf\n60’\n50’\n40’\n\n\nHalf-Elf\n55’\n45’\n35’\n\n\nHalfling\n50’\n40’\n30’\n\n\nHuman\n50’\n40’\n30’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping\nIn any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the Dungeon Master describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the party can find its way back out of the dungeon.\n\n\nLight\nA torch or lantern will provide light covering a 30’ radius; dim light will extend about 20’ further. Normal torches burn for 1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for 18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5’ radius, with dim light extending 5’ further. In general, taper candles such as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.\n\nimport {generalDice} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof torch = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Torch Turns (1d4+4)&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (4 + generalDice(1,4,0))})\n\nhtl.html`\n  &lt;div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      ${viewof torch}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"&gt;\n      Torch burn turns = ${torch}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof oil = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Oil Lantern (1d6 +18)&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (18 + generalDice(1,6,0) )})\n\nhtl.html`\n  &lt;div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      ${viewof oil}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"&gt;\n      Lantern turns = ${oil}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListening\nA careful character might choose to listen at a door before opening it. Anybody can hear noise on successful Perception check DC 15. Dwarves, Elves, & Half-Elves have an additional +1 to hear noise. Thieves have a special ability, Listen, which should be applied if the listener is a Thief. \nSounds heard might include voices, footsteps, or any other sound the DM considers appropriate. Of course, the room beyond the door might really be silent; thus, the Dungeon Master must make the roll, so that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything away to the players.\n\n\nOpen Doors\nA stuck door can be typically opened on a DC roll of 13; add the character’s Strength bonus to the range, so that a character with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a DC 11. Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on a DC 15 Strength bonus. Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a DC 20 + Strength bonus.\n\nviewof i = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Stuck Door&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 1, reduce: () =&gt; ((generalDice(1,20,0) &gt;= 13 ?

Thieves have a special ability to find and remove traps.\nDwarves have a +1 racial bonus to Investigation Skill checks when stonework traps are involved. A Dwarven Thief is a special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher. \nIn all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10’ square area. A single character may only effectively search a given area for traps once, even if the character has more than one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven Thief above).\nMagic-Users and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at a DC 17 chance.\n\n\nSecret Doors\nGenerally, searching for secret doors takes one turn per character per 10’ of wall searched. A secret door is found on a successful DC15 + Perception Skill check. Elves and half-elves have a +1 racial bonus.\nMultiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search, and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.\nNote that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of how it works. The DM may require additional rolls or other actions to be taken before the door can be opened.\n\n\nFalling Damage\nCharacters suffer 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen, up to a maximum 20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole number, so that a fall of 1-4’ does no damage, 5’-14’ does 1d6, etc.",

A typical party will have a movement rate of 40’/round and therefore can walk 20 miles per 8 hours.\n\n\nOverland Travel Modifiers\nThe movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on an 8 hour day of travel through open, clear terrain. The terrain type will alter the rate somewhat, as shown on this table:\n\n\n\nTerrain\nAdjustment\n\n\n\n\nJungle, Mountains, Swamp\n×1/2\n\n\nDesert, Forest, Hills\n×3/4\n\n\nClear, Plains, Trail\n×1\n\n\nRoad (Paved)\n×5/4\n\n\n\nCharacters may choose to perform a forced march, traveling 12 hours per day. If this is done, add an additional 50% to the distance traveled. Each day of forced march performed after the first inflicts 1d6 damage on the characters (and their animals, if any). A save vs. Death Ray with Constitution bonus applied is allowed to avoid this damage, but after this save is failed once, it is not rolled again for that character or creature. A day spent resting “restarts” the progression.\n\n\nRiding\nA horse can travel (over good terrain) 40 miles in 8 hours, alternating trotting (8 mph), walking (4 mph), and the occasional canter (12 mph). Skills such as Animal Handling or Ride allow the ability to “push” the animal to travel 2d12 additional miles.\n\n\nBecoming Lost\nThough adventurers following roads, rivers, or other obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost, striking out into trackless forest, windblown desert, and so on is another matter. Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the Wisdom of the party leader (i.e., whichever character seems to be leading). An Ability Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule is in use. The DM must determine the effects of failure\n\n\nWaterborne Travel\nTravel by water may be done in a variety of boats or ships; see the table in the Vehicles section for details. Travel distances are based on a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the usual 8 hours per day given above. Note that sailed ships may travel 24 hours per day (if a qualified navigator is aboard), and so may be able to cover twice the normal distance per day of travel. This is in addition to the multiplier given below. If the ship stops each night, as is done by some vessels traveling along a coastline as well as those vessels having less than the minimum number of regular crewmen on board, the two-times multiplier does not apply.\nMovement of sailed ships varies depending on weather conditions, as shown on the following table. Sailing movement modifiers shown apply when sailing with the wind; sailing against the wind involves tacking (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers) which reduces movement rates as indicated on the table.\n\nimport {generalTableSelect, highlightTableRow} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nInputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#wind-direction\", generalTableSelect([1,12,0],[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5],[6,6],[7,7],[8,8],[9,12]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd12\nWind Direction\n\n\n\n\n1\nNortherly\n\n\n2\nNortheasterly\n\n\n3\nEasterly\n\n\n4\nSoutheasterly\n\n\n5\nSoutherly\n\n\n6\nSouthwesterly\n\n\n7\nWesterly\n\n\n8\nNorthwesterly\n\n\n9-12\nPrevailing wind direction for this locale\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#wind-condition\", generalTableSelect([1,100,0],[[1,5],[6,13],[14,25],[26,40],[41,70],[71,85],[86,96],[97,100]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd%\nWind Conditions\nSailing\nTacking\n\n\n\n\n01-05\nBecalmed\nx0\nx0\n\n\n06-13\nVery Light Breeze\nx1/3\nx0\n\n\n14-25\nLight Breeze\nx1/2\nx1/3\n\n\n26-40\nModerate Breeze\nx2/3\nx1/3\n\n\n41-70\nAverage Winds\nx1\nx1/2\n\n\n71-85\nStrong Winds\nx1 1/3\nx2/3\n\n\n86-96\nVery Strong Winds\nx1 1/2\nx0\n\n\n97-00\nGale\nx2\nx0\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nBecalmed: Sailing ships cannot move.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to work for them. There are several categories of NPCs available for hire, as follows:\n\nRetainers\nA retainer is a close associate of his employer. Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (typically at least 15% of the employer’s income) plus support costs (weapons, armor, rations, and basic equipment provided by the employer). Retainers are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany a player character into a dungeon, lair, or ruin.\nHiring a retainer is more involved than hiring other NPCs. First, the player character must advertise for a retainer, typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in public places, or asking (and possibly paying) NPCs such as innkeepers or taverners to direct potential retainers to the player character. It is up to the Dungeon Master to rule on what must be done, and how successful these activities are.\nIf the player character is successful, one or more NPCs will present themselves to be interviewed. The Dungeon Master should play out the interview with the player, and after all offers have been made and all questions asked, a reaction roll should be made. To check the potential retainer’s reaction, the Dungeon Master rolls 2d6 and adds the player character’s Charisma bonus. In addition, the Dungeon Master may apply any adjustments he or she feels are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for higher-than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a sword +1, or a penalty if the player character offers poor terms). The roll is read as follows:\n\nimport {generalTableSelect2, highlightTableRowRet} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof reaction = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRowRet(\"#reaction-roll\", generalTableSelect2([1,20,0],[[1,1], [2,2],[3,6],[7,8],[9,12],[14,18],[19,19],[20, 20]]))})\nmd`1d20: ${reaction}`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Die Roll\nResult\n\n\n\n\n1 or less\nRefusal, -2 on further rolls\n\n\n2\nRefusal, -1 on further rolls\n\n\n3-6\nRefusal\n\n\n7-8\nTry again\n\n\n9-12\nTry again, +1 on future rolls\n\n\n14-18\nAcceptance\n\n\n19\nAcceptance, +1 to Loyalty\n\n\n20 or more\nAcceptance, +2 to Loyalty\n\n\n\n\nRefusal, -1/-2 on further rolls means that all further reaction rolls made toward that player character in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 or -2 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows. If the player character tries again in a different town, the penalty does not apply.\nIf a Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is reluctant, and needs more convincing; the player character must “sweeten” the deal in order to get an additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic item, etc. If the player character makes no better offer, treat Try again as a Refusal result.\nLoyalty: All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is generally 10 plus the employer’s Charisma bonus (or penalty). The Loyalty score is used just as the Morale score of monsters or mercenaries is used.\nIf a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 1, the Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point. Note that a Loyalty of 20 is fanatical… the retainer will do virtually anything the player character asks, and never flee in combat. However, the Dungeon Master should still apply penalties when the player character instructs the retainer to do something which appears very risky, making a failed check possible.\nIn addition, the Dungeon Master should roll a Loyalty check for each retainer at the end of each adventure, after treasure is divided, to determine if the retainer will remain with the player character. The DM may apply adjustments to this roll, probably no more than two points plus or minus, if the retainer is particularly well or poorly paid.\nMaximum Number of Retainers: A player character may hire at most 4 retainers, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty. Any attempts to hire more than this number of retainers will be met with automatic refusals.\nLevel of Retainers: Normally, potential retainers will be one-half the level of the employer (or less). So, a first level character cannot hire retainers, second level PCs can only hire first level characters, and so on. Of course, there is no way for the retainers to directly know the level of the PC employer, nor for the employer to know the level of the potential retainer; but the Dungeon Master should usually enforce this rule for purposes of game balance. It shouldn’t be surprising that first level characters can’t hire retainers, as they have no reputation to speak of yet.\nExperience for Retainers: Unlike other hired NPCs, retainers do gain experience just as other adventurers do; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each retainer. See Character Advancement.\n\n\nSpecialists\nSpecialists are NPCs who may be hired by player characters to perform various tasks. Specialists do not go on adventures or otherwise risk their lives fighting monsters, disarming traps, or any of the other dangerous things player characters and retainers may do. Rather, specialists perform services the player characters usually can’t perform for themselves, like designing and erecting castles, training animals, or operating ships.\nA player character is limited in the number of specialists he or she can hire only by the amount of money they cost; Charisma does not affect this.\nAlchemist: 1,000 gp per month.These characters are generally hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, or to assist a Magic-User with magical research.\nAn alchemist can produce a potion, given the required materials and a sample or a written formula for the potion, in the same time and for the same cost as a Magic-User. They may also research new potions, but at twice the cost in time and materials as a Magic-User. Review the rules for Magical Research for details.\nAlternately, a Magic-User seeking to create certain magic items may employ an alchemist as an assistant. In this case, the alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User’s chance of success.\nAnimal Trainer: 250 to 750 gp per month. Characters wishing to ride hippogriffs or employ carnivorous apes as guards will need the assistance of an animal trainer. The lowest cost above is for an average animal trainer, able to train one type of “normal” animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to train more than one sort of animal, or to train monstrous creatures such as hippogriffs, are more expensive to hire. The Dungeon Master must decide how long it takes to train an animal; in some cases, animal training may take years, a fact the player characters may find inconvenient as well as expensive. A single animal trainer can train and manage no more than 5 animals at a time, though in most cases once an animal is fully trained, if it is put into service right away the animal trainer won’t be needed to handle it any longer.\nArmorer (or Weaponsmith): 100 to 500 gp per month. Characters hiring mercenaries, or having armed and armored followers to take care of, will need the services of an armorer. In general, for every 50 Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care for their gear. The armorer’s equipment is not included in the costs given above, but the cost to maintain his apprentices is included; most such characters will have 1d4 apprentices assisting.\nHigher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired to assist in making magic weapons or armor; in this case, the character hired will be a specialist, an expert in making one particular type of armor or weapon, and will command a higher price (as shown above). Such characters will rarely agree to do the mundane work of maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.\nEngineer: 750 gp per month. Any player character wishing to build a fortress, a ship, or any other mundane construction will need an engineer. Large projects may require several engineers, at the DM’s option.\nSavant: 1,500 gp per month. Savants are experts in ancient and obscure knowledge. Many savants have particular interests in very limited or focused areas (for example, “Elven migrations of the 2nd age”), but even these will know or have access to a lot of facts. The listed cost is the minimum required to maintain a savant with his library, collections, etc. If the savant’s patron asks a difficult question, there may be additional costs for materials or research to answer it.\nShip’s Crew: Special. A crew for a waterborne vessel involves several types of characters. At the very least, a complement of sailors and a Captain are needed; rowers will be needed aboard galleys, and a Navigator is required aboard ships going out of sight of land.\nCosts per month for each sort of character are given below:\n\n\n\nSeaman Type\nCost\n\n\n\n\nCaptain\n300 gp\n\n\nNavigator\n200 gp\n\n\nSailor\n10 gp\n\n\nRower\n3 gp\n\n\n\nIn general, all such characters are normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or shortswords. Player characters with appropriate backgrounds may act as Captain, but unless experienced as a ship’s captain, they will have difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors (lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by an inexperienced Captain).\n\n\nMercenaries\nMercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally hired in units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters, divided into two to four squads of soldiers; each squad is led by a corporal, while the platoon is led by a lieutenant plus a sergeant. Platoons are joined together into companies, each generally consisting of two to five platoons and led by a captain with a sergeant as his assistant (called a first sergeant).\nAs mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the average mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of corporals and 50% of sergeants are 2nd level. A mercenary lieutenant will generally be 2nd level, while a captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his first sergeant will be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units will usually be beyond the reach of player characters until they have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Dungeon Master to detail.\nMercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair, or ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather, they are used in outdoor military engagements; high level player characters may hire mercenaries to defend or help defend their castles or other holdings.\nMercenaries housed in a player character’s stronghold require 200 square feet each but cost 25% less per month, as this is covered by their room and board. (Elven mercenaries, however, require 500 square feet of space each in order to reduce their pay, as they demand better living conditions.) See the Stronghold section for more details.\nStatistics are given below for the most common sorts of mercenaries; the statistics are for first level characters, and should be adjusted when higher level characters are indicated (as given above). In particular, multiply the given cost of each mercenary by his or her level. Listed costs are in gold pieces per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Mercenary\nCost\nEquipment\nMorale\n\n\n\n\nLight Foot, Human\n2\nLeather Armor, Shield, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nLight Foot, Elf\n8\nLeather Armor, Shield, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nLight Foot, Orc\n1\nLeather Armor and Spear\n11\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Human\n3\nChainmail, Shield, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Dwarf\n6\nChainmail, Shield, and Shortsword\n14\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Orc\n2\nChainmail, Shield, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nArcher, Human\n5\nLeather Armor, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nArcher, Elf\n15\nChainmail, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nArcher, Orc\n3\nLeather Armor, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nCrossbowman, Human\n5\nChainmail, Crossbow, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nCrossbowman, Dwarf\n12\nPlatemail, Crossbow, and Shortsword\n14\n\n\nLongbowman, Human\n9\nChainmail, Longbow, and Shortsword\n12\n\n\nLongbowman, Elf\n20\nChainmail, Longbow, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nLight Horseman, Human\n10\nLeather Armor, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nLight Horseman, Elf\n22\nLeather Armor, Lance, Shortbow, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nMedium Horseman, Human\n15\nChainmail, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n12\n\n\nMedium Horseman, Elf\n33\nChainmail, Lance, Shortbow, and Longsword\n14\n\n\nHeavy Horseman, Human\n20\nPlatemail, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n12",

    "text": "Experience Points (XP)\nExperience points are given for monsters defeated, and for other challenges as the DM sees fit. The following table provides XP values for monsters. Where a monster has both a character level and hit dice given, use the larger value as the monster’s level. Non-combat challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP value assigned, as the DM wishes.\nIf asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster, each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for example, a creature with a hit dice figure of 2** is worth 125 XP.\nFor monsters with more than 25 hit dice, add 750 XP to the XP Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus per additional hit die.\nNPCs should be treated as monsters of a number of hit dice equivalent to the character’s level. Add a special ability bonus for Clerics and Magic-Users if they are able to cast useful spells during the encounter.\nAfter tallying the XP earned in a given adventure, the amount should be divided by the number of adventurers. As described above, each retainer should receive a one-half share; so a group with four player characters and a retainer is counted as having 4½ members. If 2,000 XP are earned by this group, one share is 444 XP, and the retainer receives 222 XP.\nNo character may advance more than one level due to the experience points from a single adventure. For example, Harbek the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000 XP before going on an adventure; during the adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an amazing feat). This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would be a 3rd level Thief. This is not allowed; instead, he advances to 2,499 XP, one short of the amount required for 3rd level, and starts his next adventure at 2nd level.",

    "text": "Reaction Table\nWhen a group of player characters encounters one or more monsters or NPCs, it’s important to determine how these creatures will react to the party. While some reactions are obvious—such as zombies guarding a tomb almost always attacking intruders—others are not as clear-cut.\nIn situations where the reaction of the monsters or NPCs to the party is uncertain, particularly when talking, bluffing, or trading is involved, a reaction roll may be made. The Dungeon Master rolls a d20, adding the Charisma bonus (or applying the Charisma penalty) of the “lead” character, along with any other adjustments they feel are reasonable, and consults the table below:\n\nimport {generalTableSelect2, highlightTableRowRet} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof mreaction = Inputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRowRet(\"#monster-reaction\", generalTableSelect2([1,20,0],[[1,1],[2,5],[6,9],[10,11],[12,15],[16,19],[20,20]]))})\nmd`d20: ${mreaction}`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.2: Monster Reaction Roll Table\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Roll\nReaction\n\n\n\n\n1 or less (5%)\nViolently hostile, immediate Attack\n\n\n2-5 (20%)\nHostile, immediate Attack\n\n\n6-9 (20%)\nUncertain but prone to negative\n\n\n10-11 (10%)\nNeutral, uninterested, uncertain\n\n\n12-15 (20%)\nUncertain but prone to positive\n\n\n16-19 (20%)\nFriendly, immediate action\n\n\n20 or higher (5)\nEnthusiastically friendly, immediate acceptance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adjusted Roll will typically be: DC + CHA MOD + Leadership or Diplomacy Skill Bonus +/- any DM determined adjustments\n\n\nResults of 5 or less indicates that the monsters are hostile to violenlty and will normally attack immediately. If the roll is 6-9, the monsters are uncertain but lean towards a negative reaction and may attack if provoked. A roll of 10-11 means the monsters are neutral, uninterested, and uncertain, showing no strong inclination towards aggression or friendliness.\nA result of 12-15 signifies that the monsters are uncertain but tend towards a positive reaction, potentially open to parley or negotiation. When the roll is 16-19, the monsters are friendly and take immediate positive action, showing willingness to cooperate or assist the player characters. A result of 20 or higher indicates that the monsters (or their leader) are enthusiastically friendly and immediately accept the player characters, potentially offering substantial help or cooperation.\nA favorable result means that the monsters do, in fact, like the player characters; this does not mean that the monsters will just hand over their treasure, but it does indicate that they may choose to cooperate with the player characters in mutually beneficial ways.\n\nAs always, interpreting the results of this roll is left to the DM, who may choose to alter the result if he or she believes a different result would be more enjoyable to play out than the one rolled.",

    "section": "Moving",
    "text": "Moving\nEach character or creature involved in combat may move, if desired, up to its encounter movement distance, and then attack, if any opponent is in range, when its Initiative number comes up. After attacking, a character or creature may not move again until the next round.\nOpponents more than 5’ apart may move freely, but once two opposing figures are within 5’ of each other, they are “engaged” and must abide by the rules under Disengaging From Melee, below.\n\nRunning\nCharacters may choose to run; a running character is not normally allowed to attack (but see Charging, below). Running characters can move at double their normal encounter movement rate. Characters are allowed to run a number of rounds equal to 2 times the character’s Constitution, after which they are exhausted and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate). For monsters not having a given Constitution, allow the monster to run for 24 rounds. Exhausted characters or creatures must rest for at least a turn before running again.\n\n\nManeuverability\nThe following rules may be considered optional. They are hardly needed for most dungeon adventures, but will add measurably to combat situations in the wilderness, especially in waterborne combat situations or when some or all combatants are flying.\nCharacters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have a turning distance. This is given as a distance in feet in parentheses after their movement rate, and it determines how far they must move between facing changes when moving about in combat.\nAll normal player characters, and in fact most moderately sized creatures which walk on the ground, have a turning distance of 5’. If no turning distance is given for a creature, assume that it is 5’.\nIn general, a facing change is any turn of up to 90o (a right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means turning to face directly to the right or left of the figure’s current facing. A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full facing change. If using hexes, “diagonal” movement is not available, so a facing change is the 60º turn to face toward the hex-side to the right or left of the current facing.\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule:\nFirst, any creature that does not move away from its starting position during the combat round may make as many facing changes as desired (though circumstances, such as trying to turn a horse around in a narrow corridor, may prevent this).\nIncorporeal flying creatures, such as spectres, can turn freely at any point while moving.\nCreatures which are running (moving at double speed) may not make facing changes of more than 60º, and their turning distance increases by 10’ (or, if it is 5’ normally, it increases to 10’).\nAlso, most creatures can shift one space laterally while preserving their facing (this is called “sidestepping”), but this may only be done when moving at normal (“walking”) speed, not at fast (“running”) speed. “One space” means either 5’ or 10’, depending on the map or board being used.\n\n\nClimbing and Diving\nFor battles involving three dimensions, each creature or vehicle has an altitude (when flying) or depth (underwater). For air or sea battles, at least one of the creatures or vehicles should start at an altitude/depth of 0, and a new 0 level can be established at any time, to simplify play, by adjusting the altitudes of each creature or vehicle.\nA winged flier can gain up to 10’ of altitude after moving forward by the distance shown for its maneuverability class, and can dive (lose altitude in a controlled fashion) at up to twice the normal movement rate; if the creature does not move horizontally by at least one-third its normal speed, it will stall, being forced to dive at maximum rate for one round. Floating creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying carpets, etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion up to half the normal movement rate, but such “floaters” can only descend at the normal movement rate, unless they have lost the ability to float entirely.",

    "text": "Evasion and Pursuit\nSometimes a party of adventurers will want nothing more than to avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes, it’s the monsters avoiding the adventurers). If one group is surprised, and the other is not, the unsurprised group may be able to escape automatically (unless something prevents them from making an exit). Otherwise, those wanting to evade the encounter begin doing so on their Initiative numbers. Note that the rules above for Disengaging From Melee will naturally apply to any combatant who is in reach of an enemy.\nThe DM may easily play out the pursuit, following along on their map (note that the players can’t draw maps while they run headlong through the dungeon or wilderness area). Any time a character must pass through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the DM may require a saving throw vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added); if the save is failed, the character has fallen at that point and moves no further that round; they may stand up and make a full move (but not a double move) on their Initiative number in the next round.\nIf the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get beyond the pursuer’s sight for a full round, they have evaded pursuit… the pursuers have lost them.\n\nDisengaging From Melee\nWhen any combatant is within reach of the melee attacks of at least one enemy, that combatant is considered to be engaged. Such a combatant may disengage in one of two ways:\nFirst, the combatant may simply flee, turning away from all opponents they are engaged with and moving more than half normal movement. All opponents with whom they are engaged are allowed a “parting shot” with a +2 bonus to attack, even if that opponent has already made all attacks for the round. Opponents who have multiple melee attacks per round make just one; for instance, a tiger with the usual “2 claws, 1 bite” routine could only claw once or bite once.\nTo avoid the parting shot, the combatant may choose to withdraw, i.e. back away by up to half normal movement. After a withdrawal, the character may still attack at any point later in the same round if an opponent is within reach",

If the total is equal to or greater than the opponent’s Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is rolled. A natural “1” on the die roll is always a failure.

If you’re not proficient, you can still use the weapon but cannot add your Attack Bonus.\nFighters, Rangers, and Paladins start with 4 weapon proficiencies and gain 1 weapon proficiency every other level after 1st (1 at 3rd, 1 at 5th, 1 at 7th, etc.). Only true Fighters can also specialize in a weapon.\nClerics start with 3 weapon proficiencies and gain 1 weapon proficiency every 3 levels (1 at 4th, 1 at 7th, etc.). Clerics may wear any armor and have no weapon restrictions.\nDruids start with 3 weapon proficiencies and gain 1 weapon proficiency every 4 levels (1 at 5th, 1 at 9th, etc.). Druids may not utilize metal armor of any type and are likewise limited to wooden shields. Druids may utilize any one-handed melee weapons, as well as staff, sling, and short bow.\nThieves start with 3 weapon proficiencies and gain 1 weapon proficiency every 3 levels (1 at 4th, 1 at 7th, etc.). Thieves may wear leather armor without penalty to thieving abilities and have no weapon restrictions. The Assassins’ Assassinate attack must be carried out with a one-handed piercing weapon, such as a dagger or sword.\nMagic Users start with 2 weapon proficiencies and gain no new proficiencies as they spend most of their training time studying books and not practicing with weapons.\n\n\nNormal Men\nA note about normal men: The NM entry in the table above is for normal men, also known as zero level characters. These characters represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids, and other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the game. All such characters are NPCs, of course. Demi-human races have few if any zero-level characters among their numbers; the vast majority of “normal men” are humans.\nAverage zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and usually are not proficient with any weapons except bare hands. Green troops (those who have not been in battle yet) are zero-level, but they have 1d6 hit points and are allowed to use any weapon allowed to a Fighter.\nIt is recommended not to waste time in detailing the ability score or other statistics of such characters further; they are normal, as in “average,” and so very few would have extreme statistics. A blacksmith might be credited with a Strength score of 13 or more, or a savant with Intelligence of 16 or more, but in general such things need not be detailed for most of these characters.\n\n\nMonster Attack Bonus\nWhen looking up a monster’s hit dice on the Attack Bonus Table, ignore all “plus” or “minus” values; so a monster with 3+2 hit dice, or one with 3-1, is still treated as just 3 hit dice. The exception is monsters with 1-1 or lower hit dice, which are considered less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of +0.\n\n\n\nCritical Hit\nA natural 20 always hits. (barring magic or silver weapon requirements). Roll an additional d20 + modifiers to determine if it is a special.\n\n\n\nTable 20.4: Critical Hit Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll (d20)\nResult\n\n\n\n\n1-10 (50%)\nRegular Damage\n\n\n11-15 (25%)\nMaximum Damage (for example: a character with regular normal damage of 1d6 +2 would have a Maximum Damage of 6 +2 = 8)\n\n\n16-19 (20%)\nCritical Damage.

Melee weapons or attacks may generally only be used against foes who are engaged with the attacker (as described above).\n\n\nTouch Attack\nA “Touch Attack” is a melee attack that simply requires the attacker to touch their target, thus bypassing the target’s armor but not their DEX bonus. To attack, roll + attack bonus + either STR or DEX against the target’s no armor AC.\n\n\nMissile Fire\nMissile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The distance the attacker is from his target affects the attack roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon Ranges table. In general, opponents within Short range are attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range but within Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond Long range cannot be effectively attacked.\nIf a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe who is within 5’ of him or her (i.e. who is engaged with the shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe’s attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted so as to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases, apply the usual +1 bonus (+3 total bonus if attacking from behind).\n\n\nDamage\nIf an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for the weapon. Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or penalty to the damage dice, as do thrown missile weapons such as daggers or spears. Usually, attacks with bows or crossbows do not gain the Strength bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.\nAlso, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage (and cursed weapons will apply their penalty). Note that, regardless of any penalties to damage, any successful hit will do at least one point of damage.\nAs explained elsewhere, a creature or character reduced to 0 hit points is unconscious, and dying when they have negative hit points.\n\n\nSubduing Damage\nAttacks made with the “flat of the blade” for non-lethal damage are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half damage. Most weapons can be used this way; only those with penetration or slashing features on all sides cannot.\nIf a character is reduced to zero hit points who has taken at least some subduing damage, the character becomes unconscious rather than dying. (Any further subduing damage is then considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that someone might be beaten to death.) A character knocked out in this way, but not subsequently killed, will wake up with 1 hit point in 1d4 turns, or can be awakened (with 1 hit point) by someone else after 2d10 rounds.",

    "text": "Ranged Attacks\nMissile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The distance the attacker is from their target affects the attack roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon Ranges table in the Equipment section. Opponents within Short range are attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range but within Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond Long range cannot be effectively attacked.\nIf a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe that is within 5’ of them (i.e., who is engaged with the shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe’s attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases, apply the +1 bonus for Short Range and +2 for attacking from behind.\n\nMissile Weapon Rate of Fire\nIn general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack per round, just as are melee weapons. However, crossbows are an exception, as reloading a crossbow between shots is time-consuming.\nA light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and the user may not perform any other actions (including movement) during the “reloading” round. A heavy crossbow can be fired just once per three rounds, again requiring the user to spend two rounds doing nothing other than cocking and loading the weapon in order to fire it again.\nSiege engines also fire less often than ordinary weapons. The rate of fire for such a weapon is presented as a fraction, indicating the number of attacks per round; for example, 1/6 means one attack every six rounds.\nOf course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling the weapon and switch to another weapon rather than reloading. Also, it is possible (especially when defending a position) to load more than one crossbow in advance and then switch weapons each round until all have been fired. In a dungeon environment this sort of strategy is unlikely, of course.\n\n\n\nGrenade-Like Missiles\nWhen throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.), a successful attack roll indicates a direct hit. Otherwise, the DM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to determine where the missile hit. Treat each number as representing a 10’ square area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: Grenade AOT\n\n\n\n\n\nOil\nA flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil is just slippery. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage, unless he or she spends the round extinguishing the flames by some reasonable means. The DM must judge the method used; rolling on the floor (assuming it’s not oily also) or covering the flames with a wet blanket are good methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water on burning oil does little good. In any event, a flask of burning oil only causes damage for two rounds at most.\nIf the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then all other creatures within 5 feet of the point of impact receive 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid this damage. If the flask does not hit the intended target (as described under Grenade-Like Missiles, above), then that creature may still take damage from the splash, and receives a saving throw. No saving throw is allowed for a creature which has received a direct hit.\nA flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for 10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will receive 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in it (with no saving throw in this case).\nFire-resistant creatures, including creatures having fire-based abilities, are not damaged by burning oil.\n\n\nHoly Water\nHoly water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, it must be opened and poured out onto the target, generally requiring the attacker to be adjacent to the target.\nA direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage to an undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5 feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.\n\n\nMissiles That Miss\nWith the exception of grenade-like missiles, missile weapons which miss the intended target are normally considered lost. However, if the weapon is fired into a melee where allies of the shooter are involved, and the attack misses, it may hit one of the allied creatures. The DM should decide which allies may be hit, and roll attacks against each until a hit is made or all possible targets are exhausted. These attack rolls are made with the shooter’s normal attack bonus, just as if he or she intended to attack the allied creature. However, the DM must make these rolls, not the player.\nThis rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when appropriate. However, the DM still makes the rolls.\nThis rule is intentionally vague; the DM must decide when and how to apply it based on the circumstances of the battle. It is recommended that no more than three allies be “tried” in this way, but the DM may make an exception as he or she sees fit.",

    "text": "Grappling / Wrestling\nA grappling attack requires a Touch Attack (melee attack roll + attack bonus, + either Str or Dex) Success indicates the attacker has grabbed their opponent. A successful touch attack causes the attacker to move into the same “space” as the defender. Both Sides make a Grapple Check (D20+ attack bonus, + either Str or Dex, + Size Modifier) to determine if this hold is maintained. Highest DC wins.\n\n\n\nSize\nModifier\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n-4\n\n\nMedium\n+0\n\n\nLarge\n+4\n\n\n\nAfter achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with a fist), prevent a held opponent from speaking, use simple magic items such as rings, or take any other action the DM allows. The attacker may also attempt to acquire an item the opponent is holding (such as a weapon) or attempt to move the opponent (as described below). A held character may be voluntarily released whenever the attacker so desires. The attacker can’t draw or use a weapon or use a wand, staff, scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling attack, cast a spell, or pin another character while holding an opponent.\nMoving the Opponent: The attacker can move up to one-half speed (bringing the defender along) with a successful attack roll, if the attacker is strong enough to carry or drag the defender.\nAcquiring an Object: The attacker may attempt to take an item away from the defender. This requires an additional attack roll; if the roll fails, the defender may immediately attempt an attack roll (even if he or she has already attacked this round) which, if successful, results in the defender pinning the attacker; or, the defender may choose to escape instead of reversing the hold.\nActions Allowed to the Defender: The target of a successful hold is usually immobile (but not helpless) at least until his or her next action, as determined by Initiative. Such characters suffer a penalty of -4 to AC against opponents other than the attacker.\nIf the defender is significantly stronger and/or larger than the attacker, he or she may move at up to one-half speed, dragging the attacker along.\nOn the defender’s next action, he or she can try to escape the pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender must apply the better of his or her Strength or Dexterity bonuses (or penalties) on this roll. If the escape roll succeeds, the defender finishes the action by moving into any space adjacent to the attacker.\nIf more than one attacker has a hold on a particular defender, a successful escape roll frees the defender from just one of those attackers.\nHeld characters may also use simple magic items such as rings. A character being held may not normally cast a spell, even if he or she has not been silenced by the attacker.\nMultiple Opponents: Several combatants can be involved in a wrestling match. Up to four combatants can wrestle a single opponent of normal size in a given round. Creatures that are smaller than the attacker count for half, while creatures that are larger count at least double (as determined by the DM). Note that, after an opponent is pinned, other attackers benefit from the -4 AC penalty applied to the defender. However, this AC penalty is not cumulative (that is, each successful attack does not lower the defender’s AC further).\nIt is also possible for another character to attack the attacker in an ongoing wrestling bout. In this case, a successful hold on the attacker grants the original defender a +4 bonus on subsequent escape rolls.\nWrestling With Monsters: In general, the rules above can be used not only when character races wrestle but also when humanoid monsters are involved. The DM will decide whether or not to allow wrestling involving non-humanoid creatures on a case-by-case basis; if this is allowed, the following adjustments apply:\nCreatures with extra grasping appendages (more than the usual two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving throws for each such appendage. This includes creatures with feet capable of grasping (such as monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)\nLarge creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).\nWrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks (such as wights) will cause the attacker to suffer one such attack automatically every round.",

    "text": "Jousting\nJousting is a medieval sport where two combatants, mounted on horses, charge at each other with lances, aiming to unhorse their opponent. It is a display of skill, strength, and horsemanship, often held in tournaments. The event is not only a test of combat prowess but also a spectacle enjoyed by audiences, with knights in shining armor and spirited horses adding to the grandeur.\n\nRules\n\nOnly combatants are allowed on the field.\nOnly one attack is allowed for each mounted pass. Make a normal initiative roll to hit first.\nAttackers ride applying a Charge against each other. (+2 for double damage), however, since all attacks are being done simultaneously, the AC penalty does not apply except for any other attacks that may be applied to either side by third parties.\nWhen a jouster is hit by the other jouster, he must make a save versus Death Ray (however, CON does not modify this save, but add any Riding Skill bonus) or be unhorsed and land prone upon the ground.\nIf the save is failed by 4 or more, then the unhorsed individual is also stunned for 2 rounds (-2 penalty to AC as well as loss of DEX bonus if applicable and -2 penalty to attacks).\nEach 5 points of damage dealt gives a -1 penalty to the save.\nIf the save is failed by 8 or more, the individual is Knocked Out completely.\nA mounted opponent has a +2 chance to hit a mounted opponent’s horse with sword, mace, flail, or another small weapon.\nOn a roll of a natural 1 to hit, a combatant’s lance breaks on impact. The fighter may get another lance if his seconds provide them at their end of the bridge.\nA mounted combatant using a sword, mace, flail, or other small weapon can’t hit a mounted combatant using a lance.\nCombat continues, mounted or on foot, until a clear winner emerges.\nJousts may be done using subdual damage instead of lethal damage (which is often the case in tournaments), generally by using blunted lances.",

    "text": "Turning the Undead\nClerics can Turn undead, that is, drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone. The Cleric brandishes their holy symbol and calls upon the power of their divine patron. The player rolls 1d20 and adds their Wisdom Bonus.\nIf the table indicates “No”, it is not possible for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20 to Turn. Areas indicating “T” indicate that this type of undead is automatically affected. If the result shown is a “D,” then the undead is destroyed rather than merely Turned.\nIf the roll is a success, 2d6 + Wis hit dice of undead monsters are affected. Surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected if the first roll succeeds.\nIf a mixed group of undead is to be Turned, the result is checked against the weakest first.\nIf a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead monsters present are affected, they may try again in the next round to turn any remaining undead. If any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose. Turned Undead monsters flee from the Cleric at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric or those near them for at least 2d4 turns.\nUndead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little fiery embers and ash. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as above.\nNote: Evil clerics can choose to command Undead rather than turn them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric Lvl\nSkeleton\nZombie\nGhoul\nWight\nWraith\nMummy\nSpectre\nVampire\nGhost\n\n\n\n\n\n1 HD\n2 HD\n3 HD\n4 HD\n5 HD\n6 HD\n7 HD\n8 HD\n9+ HD\n\n\n1\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n2\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n3\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n4\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n8\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\n\n\n10\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\n\n\n11\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\n\n\n12\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\n\n\n13\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\n\n\n14\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n\n\n15\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n\n\n16\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n\n\n17\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n\n\n18\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n\n\n19\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n\n\n20\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof level = Inputs.select([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], {value:1, label: \"Cleric Level\"})\n\nviewof r = Inputs.select([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], {value:1, label: \"Roll\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport {turnUndead} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nres = turnUndead(level,r)",

For example, a character holding an open spellbook is struck by a fireball spell; he or she must save vs. Spells, and then save again at the same odds for the spellbook.\nThe DM should feel free to amend this rule as he or she wishes; for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might be given a single saving throw rather than laboriously rolling for each and every item.",

Subtract from this number of hours the character’s Constitution bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution needs only 3 hours sleep per night (and a character with 3 Constitution needs 9 hours). Note that these figures are minimums; given a choice, most characters would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.\nCharacters who get less than the required amount of sleep suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws (as well as not receiving any hit points of healing). For each additional night where sufficient sleep is not received, the penalty becomes one point worse. Regardless of how long the character has gone without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep will remove these penalties.",

    "section": "Conditional States",
    "text": "Conditional States\nIf more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.\n\nAbility Damaged and Constitution Point Losses\nWhen a creature suffers ability damage, it temporarily loses 1 or more points from one or more ability scores. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless otherwise noted by the condition causing the damage.\n\nA creature with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless.\nA creature with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed.\nA creature with Constitution 0 is dead.\nA creature with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious.\n\nAbility damage differs from penalties to ability scores, which disappear once the conditions causing them go away.\n\nConstitution Point Losses\nWhen a character temporarily loses Constitution points (such as due to a disease), they may regain them with normal rest. The recovery rate is one point per day, awarded each morning after a normal night’s sleep. If more than one Constitution point was lost, the character must make a save vs. Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the final point; failure results in the permanent loss of that point.\nIf a temporary Constitution loss results in a lower bonus or penalty, the character’s maximum hit points must be adjusted accordingly. For example, if a character’s Constitution drops from 16 to 15, their bonus decreases from +2 to +1, resulting in a loss of one hit point per die rolled. If this adjustment reduces the maximum hit points to less than the current hit points, the current hit points are immediately reduced to the new maximum.\nWhen regaining Constitution, any increase that raises the character’s Constitution bonus restores the lost hit points to the maximum hit point figure only. Current hit points must be regained through normal healing methods.\n\n\n\nBlindness\nA blinded creature suffers the following effects:\n\nA -4 penalty to attack rolls.\nA -4 penalty to Armor Class.\nA -2 penalty to Initiative rolls.\nMovement is at half speed.\nThe creature is surprised on a DC 6 check.\n\nThese effects may be modified for creatures with unusual sensory abilities. For example, bats may be affected by deafness as if blinded instead. These penalties apply primarily to characters or creatures recently handicapped. Those who are normally blind may have reduced penalties at the DM’s discretion.\n\n\nBlown Away\nDepending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity.\n\nA creature on the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.\nA flying creature that is blown away is pushed back 2d6 × 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.\n\n\n\nChecked\nPrevented from achieving forward motion by an applied force, such as wind. Checked creatures on the ground merely stop. Checked flying creatures move back a distance specified in the description of the effect.\n\n\nConfused\nA confused creature’s actions are determined by rolling a d20 at the beginning of its turn:\n\n1-3: Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible).\n4-8: Act normally.\n9-13: Do nothing but babble incoherently.\n14-17: Flee away from caster at top possible speed.\n18-20: Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self).\n\nA confused creature that can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character that is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn if it is still confused.\nA confused creature does not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).\n\n\nCowering\nThe creature is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering creature takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and loses its Dexterity bonus.\n\n\nDazed\nThe creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions but has no penalty to AC. A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.\n\n\nDazzled\nThe creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks.\n\n\nDead\nThe creature’s hit points are reduced to -10, its Constitution drops to 0, or it is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves its body. Dead creatures cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic.\nA dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.\n\n\nDeafness\nDeafened creatures cannot hear and can react only to what it can see or feel, is surprised on a DC 10, and suffers a -1 penalty to its Initiative rolls.\nThey automatically fail Listen checks and have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.\nA creature who remains deafened for a long time grows accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.\n\n\nDiseased\nDisease sets in after 1d4 hours. A diseased target suffers a -2 penalty on initiative, to hit, and on saves. Cure disease will end the effect.\n\n\nDrowning\nCharacters can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus their Constitution bonus before they start drowning.\n\n\nDying\nA dying creature is unconscious and near death. At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character loses 1 hit point. If a dying character reaches -10 hit points, the character is dead. A dying creature can be stabilized with aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing).\n\n\nEnergy Drain\nCharacters may sometimes be exposed to energy drain from undead or evil magic, resulting in “negative levels.”\n\nEffects:\n\nNegative Levels: The creature gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the character’s levels. If the subject has as many negative levels as Hit Dice, they die.\nPenalties: Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties:\n\nA -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.\nLoss 1d[Class Hit Dice] of hit points. e.g. 1d4 for a Magic-user\nA -1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).\n\nSpellcasting: A spellcaster loses access to one of their highest-level spell slots.\nSaving Throw: Whether a saving throw is allowed to resist the effect depends on the specific monster type.\nImmediate Death: If a character’s hit points are reduced to zero or less by energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If an undead monster causes the energy drain, the victim is usually transformed into that sort of undead, with exact details varying by type.\n\n\n\nRecovery:\nNegative levels can be removed by magic, such as the restoration spell. To determine how many hit points are restored when a negative level is removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by the number of negative levels, rounding normally.\nFor example, if a character suffers three negative levels of energy drain with hit point losses of 6, 5, and 2 (totaling 13 points lost), the first negative level removed restores 13 / 3 = 4.33 hit points (rounded to 4). Now the character has two negative levels and 9 hit points lost. The next negative level removed restores 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points (rounded to 5). The final negative level removal restores the remaining 4 points.\nThose who have suffered energy drain typically appear gaunt and haggard, a noticeable change to observant characters.\n\n\n\nEntangled\n\nThe creature is ensnared and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however.\n\n\n\nExhausted\n\nAn exhausted creature moves at half speed and takes a -3 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 3 turns of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.\n\n\n\nFascinated\n\nA fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks.\nAny potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon or casting a spell, automatically breaks the effect.\n\n\n\nFatigued\n\nA fatigued creature can neither run nor charge and takes a -1 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued creature to become exhausted. After 3 turns of complete rest, fatigued creatures are no longer fatigued.\n\n\n\nFrightened\n\nA frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.\n\n\n\nGrappled\n\nEngaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. They do not threaten any squares and lose Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents they aren’t grappling.\nAn opponent is pinned if the attacker wins three consecutive Grapple Checks. A pinned opponent is held immobile.\n\n\n\nHelpless\n\nA helpless creature is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (-5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.\nAs a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided they are adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. If the defender survives, they must make a DC check (DC 10 + damage dealt – Con) or die.\n\n\n\nIncorporeal\n\nHaving no physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Only other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects can harm an incorporeal creature.\n\n\n\nInsane\n\nA creature suffering from insanity loses the ability to think rationally or understand what is happening around them. They may experience hallucinations, delusions, and extreme paranoia. An insane creature is incapable of performing any deliberate actions and cannot distinguish friend from foe. They may exhibit unpredictable behavior, including attacking allies or fleeing from nonexistent threats. Insanity typically imposes a severe penalty on all skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, usually around -6 or more, reflecting the complete disarray of the creature’s mental state. The exact nature of an insane creature’s behavior can vary, but it is always detrimental and chaotic. This condition can only be cured by powerful magic, such as a Heal spell or similar effects.\n\n\n\nInvisible\n\nAn invisible creature is visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents and ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See Invisibility, under Special Abilities.)\n\n\n\nNauseated\n\nExperiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move action per turn.\n\n\n\nPanicked\n\nA panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.\n\n\n\nParalyzed\n\nA paralyzed creature is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls.\nA paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.\n\n\n\nPetrified\n\nA petrified creature has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified creature cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as they return to flesh, they are unharmed. If the creature’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.\n\n\n\nPinned\n\nA pinned opponent is held immobile.\n\n\n\nPoisoned\n\nA poisoned target suffers a -2 penalty on initiative, to hit and on saving throws. While poisoned in this way, the target can’t regain hit points.\n\n\n\nProne\n\nThe creature is on the ground. An attacker who is prone has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks but takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks. Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.\n\n\n\nShaken\n\nA shaken creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.\n\n\n\nSickened\n\nThe creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.\n\n\n\nStable\n\nA creature that was dying but has stopped losing hit points and still has negative hit points is stable. A stable creature is no longer dying but is still unconscious. If the creature is stable because of aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses hit points. There is a slim chance (DC 20 + Constitution) that a character can become stable without aid.\n\n\n\nStaggered\n\nA creature whose nonlethal damage exactly equals their current hit points is staggered. A staggered creature may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can the character take full-round actions). A creature whose current hit points exceed their nonlethal damage is no longer staggered; a character whose nonlethal damage exceeds their hit points becomes unconscious.\n\n\n\nStunned\n\nA stunned creature drops everything that they are holding, can’t take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses their Dexterity bonus to AC.\n\n\n\nTurned\n\nUndead that are affected by a turn undead attempt must flee for 10 rounds (1 minute) by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower.\n\n\n\nUnconscious\n\nAn unconscious creature is knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having current hit points drop to 0 or below, or from nonlethal damage more than current hit points.",

    "title": "24  Monsters Intro",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Terms\nName: The first thing given for each monster is its name (or its most common name, if the monster is known by more than one). If an asterisk appears after the monster’s name, it indicates that the monster is only able to be hit by special weapons (such as silver or magical weapons, or creatures affected only by fire, etc.) which makes the monster harder to defeat.\nArmor Class: This line gives the creature’s AC for normal combat. If the monster customarily wears armor, the first listed AC value is with that armor, and the second, in parentheses, is unarmored. Some monsters are only able to be hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons; these are indicated with (s); some monsters may only be hit with magical weapons, indicated by (m)\nHit Dice: This is the creature’s number of hit dice, including any bonus hit points. Monsters always roll eight sided dice (d8) for hit points, unless otherwise noted. So for example, a creature with 3+2 hit dice rolls 3d8 and adds 2 points to the total. A few monsters may be marked as having ½ hit dice; this means 1d4 points, and the creature has “less than one hit die” for attack bonus purposes\nOne or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice figure; where present, they indicate a Special Ability Bonus to experience points (XP) awarded for the monster. See Character Advancement.\nIf the monster’s Attack Bonus (see Table 20.3) is different than its number of Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus will be listed in parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.\nMovement: This line gives the monster’s movement rate, or rates for those monsters able to move in more than one fashion. For example, Bugbears have a normal walking movement of 30’, and this is all that is listed for them. Mermaids can only move about in the water, and so their movement is given as Swim 40’. Pegasi can both walk and fly, so their movement is listed as 80’ Fly 160’.\nIn addition, a distance may appear in parentheses after a movement figure; this is the creature’s turning distance. If a turning distance is not listed, assume 5’.\nAttacks: The number (and sometimes type or types) of attacks the monster can perform. For example, Goblins may attack once with a weapon, so they are marked 1 weapon. Ghouls are marked 2 claws/1 bite as they can attack with both claws and also bite in one round. Some monsters have alternate attacks, such as the triceratops with an attack of 1 gore or 1 trample which means that the creature can do a gore attack or a trample attack, but not both in the same round.\nDamage: The damage figures caused by successful attacks by the monster. Generally this will be defined in terms of one or more die rolls.\nNo. Appearing: This is given in terms of one or more die rolls. Monsters that only appear underground and have no lairs will have a single die roll; those that have lairs and/or those that can be found in the wilderness will be noted appropriately. For example, a monster noted as “1d6, Wild 2d6, Lair 3d6” is encountered in groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting, 2d6 individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a lair.\nNote that number appearing applies to combatants. Non-combatant monsters (juveniles, and sometimes females) do not count in this number. The text of the monster description should explain this in detail where it matters, but the DM is always the final arbiter.\nSave As: The character class and level the monster uses for saving throws. Most monsters save as Fighters of a level equal to their hit dice.\nMorale: The number that must be rolled equal to or less than on 2d6 for the monster to pass a Morale Check. Monsters having a Morale of 20 never fail morale checks, and fight until destroyed (or until they have no enemies left).\nTreasure Type: This line reflects how much wealth the creature owns. See the Treasure section for more details. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.\nXP: The number of experience points awarded for defeating this monster. In some cases, the figure will vary; for instance, Dragons of different age categories will have different XP values. Review the Experience Points awards table in the Adventure section, to calculate the correct figure in these cases.",

Such creatures obviously have no treasure.\nCamels are large animals found in arid environments that bear distinctive fatty deposits known as “humps” on their backs. There are two relevant species of camel described here: the far more common one-humped dromedary, and the two-humped Bactrian camel. Statistics presented above are for the dromedary; the Bactrian camel is slower and its movement is given in brackets. A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 800 pounds.\nDonkeys are hoofed mammals in the same family as the horse. They are smaller, but are strong and hardy. Burros are a similar species, and the statistics herein can be used for either; both varieties are capable of being taken into dungeons as pack animals. A light load for a donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140 pounds.\nMules are a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey and a horse. Mules vary widely in size, and may be of any color. They are more patient, hardier and longer- lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys. Like donkeys, they are capable of being taken into dungeons as pack animals. A light load for a mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 600 pounds.\nDraft Horses are large horses bred to be working animals doing hard tasks such as plowing and other farm labor. There are a number of breeds, with varying characteristics, but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament. A light load for a draft horse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.\nRiding Horses are smaller horses bred and trained for riding. They cannot effectively fight while the rider is mounted. A light load for a riding horse is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load, up to 500 pounds.\nWar Horses are large, powerful horses which are both bred for their size, strength, and combat ability and trained to tolerate the sounds and stresses of battle. They are able to attack while the rider is mounted due to their training. A light load for a warhorse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up to 700 pounds\nA Pony is a variety of small horse. Compared to a larger horse, a pony may have a thicker coat, mane and tail, with proportionally shorter legs, a wider barrel, heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader head. Ponies can be trained for war, and equiped with barding; this does not allow them to fight while a rider is mounted, however. A light load for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.",

Such creatures are often skittish and likely to flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (the parenthesized morale applies in this case).\nGenerally, 1 hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and 4 hit die animals inflict 1d8.

They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants.",

A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.\nAn assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.\nA mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.\nA subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.",

They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall and typically weigh around 45 pounds. They are pack hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in small groups but bold when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.\nBarklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.\nBarklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.\nIn combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).\nOne out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.\nBarklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult.",

A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.",

Teleportation is so easy for them that they can sometimes teleport away before being attacked; specifically, when a flicker beast know of the attacker’ presence. The flicker beast is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about).\nThese creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.\nBlink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted. They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information. They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate deceivers and will generally attack them on sight.",

These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.\nThe fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30’ from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the plant-creature’s attacks; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.\nEach blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) “eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.",

Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.\nBugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting, they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.\nOne out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.",

They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.\nA caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.\nOnce a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.",

Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the DM. Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge. Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.\nA typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).\nAurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough- looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines. All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general way, as described above.\nAn ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.",

An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive “hairs” on their legs to sense the environment around them.\nThese creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.\nAll giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The DM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.\nAny giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster’s shrieking.\nA giant cave locust can leap up to 60’ horizontally, or up to 30’ up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.\nFinally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10’ away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.",

This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.\nAny character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter, all attacks against displacers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind. Some monsters, such as bats, do not depend on vision to fight and thus may be able to perceive the monster’s true location and fight without penalty.",

    "title": "25  Monster Descriptions",
    "section": "Dragon",
    "text": "Dragon\nDragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.\nIf one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 20 in combat since they are protecting their young.\nIn combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws, a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of breath weapon. Tactically, dragons prefer to fight while flying, making passes over ground-based enemies to strike or breathe on them. Smarter and older dragons will look for the toughest or most dangerous foe to strike down first, particularly preferring to eliminate magic-users as early in a fight as possible.\nEach dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.\nThe breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.\nThere are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon’s breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (DM’s option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes.\nThe shapes are:\nCone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon’s mouth, and is about 2’ wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon’s type and age).\nLine Shaped: The breath weapon is 5’ wide (regardless of the given width figure) and extends the given length in a straight line.\nCloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, any length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20’ deep or high.\nAll dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;” this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or some other humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the DM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.\nSome dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.\nAll dragons crave wealth, hoarding as many coins, gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in their lair as possible. The greater a dragon’s hoard, the less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must hunt for food from time to time. Dragons rarely trust any other creature to defend their hoard, though some will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live nearby in the hopes that they will kill and eat any thieves who might come nosing around.\nUnlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full treasure for each dragon individually. Treasure for dragons is special, as noted on the treasure section . The odds of monetary treasure increase with the monster’s age category, while the chances of gems, jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice.\nYoung dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen slowly become dull. Experience Points (XP) given for dragons on the following pages are for non-spell-casting dragons of age category 4. The DM must calculate the XP award for any specific dragon as given in the character advancement section, adding a special ability bonus (i.e. a “star”) if the dragon casts spells.",

Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.\nShy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring – they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell charm person), attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.",

However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.\nGiant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one",

Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60’, causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.\nEfreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.\nDue to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.",

    "text": "Elemental*\nAn elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Dungeon Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.\nEach type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:\nConjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell conjure elemental; or,\nSummoned by means of a magical staff; or,\nSummoned by a device (as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.\nThese three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:\n\n\n\nType\nHit Dice\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n8\n\n\nDevice\n12\n\n\nConjured\n16\n\n\n\nThe summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.\nElementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.\nNon-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental’s attack form should suffer.\nGenerally, elementals are immune to both normal and magical forms of their own attack form. Most are more susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each type.",

A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.\nSeeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs. a given ghost’s fear attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.\nA ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the DM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.\nLost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character’s Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be raised (but still may be reincarnated).\nOnce per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.\nInstead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs. Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target’s body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim’s body, or until it is driven out by means of a remove curse spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities.",

Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6.

The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghoul in all respects.\nGhasts look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but they are smarter and just a bit more powerful. Refer to the previous paragraphs for information about their claw attacks and other abilities.\nThe stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.\nThey may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the DM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.\nHumanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly incompatible with the creature’s new form (as decided by the DM). For such ghasts, the DM should also adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects.",

Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.\nCloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.\nCloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200’ for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.",

Females are slightly smaller, standing 22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen as little more than that. This is underselling the mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is primitive they have an intricately detailed social structure.\nMountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter. They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory. Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed. The “lair” encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.\nThey wear armor made of wood held together with heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.\nA mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240’ for 4d6 points of damage each",

At the end of this time, the character can make a DC 20 Intelligence check to successfully assemble the mule. If the character possesses the assembly instructions and can read Arcane, they receive an additional +1. - Success: The clockwork mule is assembled correctly and functions as intended. - Failure: The character ends up with leftover parts. They must spend an additional 1d4 hours adjusting and can then attempt a new Intelligence check to complete assembly.\nThe mule requires 5 gold pieces daily to operate. If it goes more than 24 hours without this sustenance, it will cease functioning and become dormant until fed again.\n\n\nConstruct Nature\nThe clockwork mule doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n\nAutonomous Following\nThe mule can follow an operator when they whistle to it. It will continue to follow until instructed to stay by the operator clicking their tongue.\n\n\nCarrying Capacity\nIt can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight, making it quite robust for transporting goods.\n\n\nHidden Storage Compartment\nThere is a hidden hatch at the rear with a storage space that is 2 feet wide, 2 feet long, and 2 feet deep. This compartment is airtight and watertight when closed, ensuring the safety of stored items.\n\n\nWater Adaptability\nWhen submerged in water, the mule deploys flotation devices automatically. This allows it to float on the water’s surface, preventing it from sinking.",

When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class.

If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.\nGnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.\nMost gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such.

They must be given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the controller must usually be within 60 feet of the golem to do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow the last instructions given to it until the controller returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow the commands of another, but can always resume control if desired (i.e. the controller’s commands always take precedence).\nEmploying a golem in combat is tricky, for once one attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3% the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following commands and become berserk. Once this happens the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing targets randomly when there are more than one. If all targets are killed or driven away the golem will move on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all possible.\nThe berserk chance for a golem that is still under control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive, neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.\nThe creator of the golem (but not any other person who might have been delegated control) may try to calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention to the creator and pursues them with single-minded hatred.\nIf a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5 rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to stop it. It has no special way to find the creator, however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is successfully calmed, it can be given commands again on the very next round of combat.\nAs their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a Fighter of 4th level.",

Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.\nHobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.\nOne out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20’, having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement is still 20’) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.",

When attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds them and walks on all four feet.\nLike the more common rust monster (as found on page 138), the touch of any part of an ironbane’s body transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non- magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.\nThe metal oxides created by this monster are its food; thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this.\nMetals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored. Silver and copper on the other hand are candy for this creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling adventurer in any party.",

A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60’, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of light spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.\nOne out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10’, and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.\nKobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid.",

They live in social groups called prides consisting of a few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.\nGroups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2 is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues, living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt as individuals or in pairs.\nLions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

Males and females are basically the same size, and it is quite difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor and carry shields in battle.\nLizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\nLizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.\nSubterranean lizard men, also called troglodytes, are superficially very similar to the common variety. Their skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat “hunched” stance. They weigh about as much as the common type.\nThese monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.\nSubterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled.",

These prehistoric relatives of the elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with each other in a rudimentary way. They are more aggressive than the common elephant and will attack any creature they see as a threat.\nThey have the same basic attack modes as mammoths, with the same limitations as given above.\nA light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy load, up to 16,000 pounds.\nA mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 1d10 x 100 gp.",

The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa’s reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.\nFurther, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).\nA medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.\nMedusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.",

Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.\nA mermaid’s song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid’s temperament.\nContrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.\nMermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.\nThree-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.\nOne-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.\nA mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.\nMermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.",

Like sprites, pixies love beauty. They dress in bright colors and favor clothing with flourishes like feathered caps, curly-tipped shoes, scarves, and so on. They are quite small, just 2½ feet in height and weighing no more than 30 pounds. Pixies can only fly for 3 turns maximum before requiring rest of at least one turn, during which time the pixie may walk at normal speed but may not fly.\nA pixie can become invisible at will, as many times per day as it wishes, and can attack while remaining invisible. Anyone attacking an invisible pixie does so with an attack penalty of -4 unless the attacker can somehow detect invisible creatures. Pixies may ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so, they surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.\nPixies are whimsical, enjoying nothing so much as a good joke or prank, especially at the expense of a “big person.”",

A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.",

The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See Constitution Point Losses in the Encounter section for details on regaining lost Constitution.\n* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size.

Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an elongated pair of forelegs with sticky pads on them for capturing prey.\nGiant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.\nA hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa’s mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).\nThe rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.",

Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).\nA light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full- grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.\nA roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).\nWhen rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 20 in this case).",

A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only a cure disease can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim’s heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.",

One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non- magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the monster.\nThe metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal.\nWhether the rust monster is in any way related to the rarer ironbane (as found on page 115) is unknown, but both monsters seem to have the exact same power.",

Don’t forget to account for the weight of armor worn!\nIf a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black “ink” 30’ in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds. If a group fails a morale check they will move away in random directions in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit.",

They are relatively small, just about 1 foot long with a wingspan of about 2 feet and an average weight of 1 pound. They vaguely resemble hairless bats with a rubbery tubular proboscis and no back legs (so that their body simply comes to a blunt point at the rear).\nIf a stirge hits a living creature, it grabs on with hooked claws on its wing joints and quickly embeds its proboscis in the victim’s body. The proboscis has rows of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim’s body. This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then proceeds to suck the victim’s blood, inflicting an additional 1d4 points of damage each round.\nOnce attached, the creature can only be removed by killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.",

They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant’s base.\nBecause it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.\nStrangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.\nEach plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.\nThere is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above- ground variety of the plant.",

When one stands still with its legs together it cannot be easily distinguished from a normal oak tree. Their leaves are nearly identical to oak leaves, and are green in spring and summer, turning orange, red, or yellow in the fall and winter. A treant’s leaves do not normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in identifying one.\nBeing actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35 feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Their language is difficult for most other races to learn, though Elves are known to have an advantage in mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who live near humans learn Common as well.\nTreants are slow to act when potential enemies are nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking any action. Because of their excellent camouflage treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\nAll treants have the power to animate other normal trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at once, but the treant can release one and animate another if needed. Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state. An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10’ per round. Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted. If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.\nAny character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree. The DM should consider battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results of such an event.",

They stand up to 9 feet tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining thing imaginable.\nTrolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid.\nThe regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if severed simply by pressing the severed ends back together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves, but only if it’s convenient. If the severed part is not restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.\nNote that a troll with a new head will not remember its former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will behave as would any confused and hostile animal.\nTrolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending on which of these species live nearest them. A few (20% or so) speak Common.\nTrolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.\nA trollwife is a female troll; despite the name, there is no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds. They have no outward appearance of femininity, at least according to the standards of humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color.\nTrollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the males of the species; in particular, they regenerate exactly as do the males.\nWhen encountered, a trollwife may be alone, cohabitating with a male (her “husband”), or raising a brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young; on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are present.\nAdd 1 to the trollwife’s morale score if she is with her mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that, unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight without checking morale while her offspring are present. If a trollwife’s mate or offspring are slain in her absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.\nTrollwives are solitary with respect to other adult trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce passion. If forced together they will put aside their enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest of the remains).",

Even an infant has the same ability to regenerate as an adult troll.\nWhen you encounter trollkin, you can rest assured that there is a trollwife nearby (unless, of course, you’ve already slain her). They are as bloodthirsty as their parents; as such, determining the number appearing is done in a particularly unusual fashion:\nRoll 1d6 for the number of individuals, and 2d6 for the number of hit dice. Divide the number of hit dice by the number of individuals to arrive at the hit dice of each individual. Note that a trollkin won’t be encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll totals more than 6, you must increase the number of individuals. The referee should feel free to round the number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their mother is out hunting.\nRefer to the entry for trolls for details regarding regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as noted above, trollkins share all these features with the adults",

A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.\nUnicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.\nThree times per day a unicorn can cast cure light wounds by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360’ (as the spell dimension door), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.\nAn Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.\nAlicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a ring of invisibility.",

All urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in four such offspring will share their father’s gifts. Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.\nSome hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive.",

Though they may look just a bit more pale than when they were alive, they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do. A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.\nVampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them. A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.\nThe bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the “parent” vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).\nIf using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.\nVampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.\nCreatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.\nVampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66), giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will. The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.\nVampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.\nFirst, a vampire can be held at bay by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (DM’s discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.\nRunning water (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.\nFinally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.\nDestroying a vampire is not an easy task. When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained). If exposed to direct sunlight, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time. Being immersed in running water (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the vampire is cremated in a funeral pyre while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.\nThe most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: driving a wooden stake through its heart. Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain “dead” for so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above. It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire’s heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction.",

Each creature can do 2d4 points of damage to a ship’s hull per round (no roll required) for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature’s hit dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat noisily.\nThese creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.",

Once a giant weasel bites a living creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of its victim and flee.\nThere are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.",

They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.\nWyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.\nWyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than themselves.

A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack or when landing.\nIf a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.",

    "text": "Using Magic Items\nTo use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly.\nMany items are activated just by using them. For instance, a character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, wear a ring, or don a cloak. Activation of these items is generally straightforward and self-explanatory. This doesn’t mean that if you use such an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.\nIf no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.\nA command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Note that many magic items must be held in the hand (or otherwise specially handled or worn) to be used; the risk of accidental activation is less significant for such items.\nLearning the command word for an item may be easy (sometimes the word is actually inscribed on the item) or it may be difficult, requiring the services of a powerful wizard or sage, or some other means of discovery.\nOnly the character holding or wearing a magic item may activate it. A character who has been gagged or silenced may not activate a magic item which requires a command word.\nWhen an article of magic armor, clothing or jewelry (including a ring) is discovered, size is not usually an issue. Such items magically adjust themselves for wearers from as small as Halflings to as large as Humans. This effect is called accommodation. The DM may create “primitive” items lacking this power if he or she wishes.\nGenerally only one magical item of a given type may be worn at the same time. For example, a character can normally only wear one suit of armor, wear one necklace and carry one shield at a time. In the case of rings, a character may wear one magical ring per hand. If a character wears more items of a given type than would normally be practical, the items will usually fail to function due to interference with one another; for instance, wearing two rings on the same hand normally results in both rings failing to operate. Note, however, that this limitation cannot be used to disable cursed magic items. For example, wearing a cursed ring would prevent another magic ring from being worn and used on that hand, but the curse would not be lifted by donning a second magic ring.",

    "text": "Magic Weapons\nA magical weapon will typical have a bonus which is applied to all attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. Somme rare magic weapons are created with a variety of powers and will usually aid the wielder in combat.\n\nExample powers\nCasts Light on Command: By drawing the weapon and uttering a command word, the wielder may cause it to glow; it will then shed light with the same radius as a light spell. Sheathing or laying down the weapon, or speaking the command word again, dispels the effect. This power may be used as often as desired.\nCharm Person: This power allows the wielder to cast charm person once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User, by brandishing the weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the target creature. (The wielder’s gaze does not have to be met for the spell to be cast.) The target creature is allowed saving throws just as described in the spell description.\nDrains Energy: A weapon with this power drains one life energy level on a hit, as described under Energy Drain in the Encounter section; up to 2d4 levels can be drained by a weapon with this power, after which time the weapon loses this power but retains any other magical effects or bonuses.\nFlames on Command: Upon command, the weapon will be sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until the command is given again, or until the weapon is dropped or sheathed. While it flames, all damage done by the weapon is treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus (in addition to the weapon’s normal bonus) is added to damage when fighting trolls, treants, and other creatures especially vulnerable to fire. It casts light and burns just as if it were a torch.\nLocate Objects: This power allows the wielder to cast the spell locate object once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User.\nSpecial Enemy: These weapons are created to combat a specific sort of creature, as rolled on the Special Ability table. When used against that specific enemy, the second listed bonus applies instead of the first; so a sword +1, +3 vs. Undead would provide +1 attack and damage against giant rats, but +3 attack and damage rolls against zombies.\nWishes: Weapons with this power have the ability to grant 1d4 wishes. The DM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Dungeon Master  section regarding this. After these wishes have been made, the weapon loses this power, but retains any other bonuses and powers.\nCursed Weapons inflict a penalty to the wielder’s attack rolls, as rolled on the Weapon Bonus table. The curse causes the afflicted character to be unable to get rid of the weapon. There are two possible forms the curse may take: Obsession and Affliction. The DM may decide which to use at his or her option.\nObsession: Regardless of how severe the penalty is, the character wielding the weapon will believe it is a bonus and refuse to use any other weapon in combat. A remove curse spell is the only way to rid a character of such a weapon; but as he or she will believe the weapon is the best magical weapon ever, the character receives a saving throw vs. Spells to resist.\nAffliction: The character knows the weapon is cursed as soon as he or she uses it in combat; however, any attempt to throw it away fails, as the weapon magically appears back in the character’s hand whenever he or she tries to draw any other weapon. In this case, the remove curse spell needed to rid the character of the weapon will be unopposed (i.e. no saving throw).",

    "text": "Magic Armor\nMagic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. In general, magic armor grants the normal Armor Class for its type, plus the magical armor bonus, as rolled on the Magic Armor table; for example, Plate Mail +2 provides an Armor Class of 19.\nThere are two varieties of cursed armor: Cursed Armor -1 and Cursed Armor AC 11. The first variety’s AC is reduced by the rolled penalty; for example, Plate Mail -1 grants Armor Class 16. The second type is much worse, for regardless of the type, it only provides Armor Class 11. Dexterity and shield bonuses still apply.\nCursed armor cannot be removed from the wearer once the curse is proven, that is, once the wearer is hit in combat. Once the curse has taken effect, only a remove curse spell, or some more powerful magic (such as a wish), will enable the wearer to remove it. The armor will detect as magical, like any other magic armor; the curse cannot be detected by any means other than wearing the armor in combat.",

    "text": "Potions\nA potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker. Unless otherwise noted, a potion grants its benefits for 1d6+6 turns (even if the duration of an associated spell is longer or shorter).\nAlmost all potions are created by Kappiyan Flurmastyr, master alchemist from Glantry. The glass bottles bear his symbol: a large circle, within which is a triangle, containing a square, within which is a circle. An additional symbol indicates the nature of the potion.\n\n\nPotion Miscibility\nWhen two potions are mixed, there is a chance for unpredictable outcomes, ranging from disastrous results to potentially enhancing the potency of one or both potions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll Range\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n01\nCreates an explosion, dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 feet.\n\n\n02-03\nThe mixture becomes a potion of poison.\n\n\n04-08\nThe mixture becomes a potion of delusion that mimics one of the mixed potions’ effects.\n\n\n09-15\nBoth potions lose their effects.\n\n\n16-25\nOne potion loses its effect.\n\n\n26-35\nBoth potions work, but with half their normal effects. Effects unable to be halved are lost.\n\n\n36-90\nBoth potions work normally.\n\n\n91-99\nBoth potions work. One potion has 150% of its normal effect or increased duration.\n\n\n00\nOnly one potion works, and its effect is permanent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlchemist’s fire\nAlchemist’s fire is a concoction of volatile liquids that ignite upon exposure to air. When hurled as a splash weapon, treat it as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage.\nUpon impact, every creature within 10 feet of the splash point takes 1 point of fire damage. Additionally, on the following round after a direct hit, the target sustains an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. The affected creature can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.\n\n\nPotion of Cat’s Grace\nCat’s Grace is a potent elixir that temporarily enhances Dexterity to a score of 20. While under its effects, the drinker gains the following benefits:\n\n\n\nBonus Type\nBonus Amount\n\n\n\n\nRanged Attacks\n+5\n\n\nDragon Breath Saves\n+5\n\n\nDexterity-related Skills\n+5\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\nPotion of Clairaudience\nThe Clairaudience potion enables the drinker to hear sounds from another area up to 60 feet away through the ears of a living creature in that area. This effect functions similarly to the spell clairvoyance.\n\n\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nThis potion grants the imbiber the effect of the clairvoyance spell.\n\n\nPotion of Cold Resistance:\nThis potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell resist cold.\n\n\nPotion of Control Animal\nThis potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only normal, non-magical animals.\n\n\nPotion of Control Dragon\nThis potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only dragons.\n\n\nPotion of Control Giant\nThis potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only giants.\n\n\nPotion of Control Human\nThis potion allows the drinker to charm a human, demi-human, or humanoid by gazing at them. The effect functions like the charm person spell. If the charm is resisted, the drinker can attempt to charm up to two more targets before the potion’s benefit is exhausted.\n\n\nPotion of Control Plant\nThis potion grants the drinker control over one or more plants or plant creatures within a 10’ square area up to 50’ away. Normal plants become animated, having a movement rate of 10’, and obey the drinker’s commands. If ordered to attack, only the largest plants can do any real harm, attacking with a +0 attack bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per hit. Affected plant creatures (who fail to save vs. Spells) can understand the drinker, and behave as if under a charm monster spell.\n\n\nPotion of Control Undead\nThis potion grants the drinker command of 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Mindless undead follow the drinker’s commands exactly; free-willed undead act as if under a charm person spell.\n\n\nPotion of Delusion:\nThis cursed potion will appear, if tested or analyzed, to be one of the other potions (other than poison). When imbibed, the drinker will briefly believe he has received the benefits of the “other” potion, but the illusion will be swiftly exposed…\n\n\nPotion of Diminution\nThis potion reduces the drinker and all items worn or carried to one-twelfth of his or her original height (so that a 6’ tall character becomes 6” tall). The drinker’s weight is divided by 1,728; this makes an armed warrior weigh less than 2.5 ounces. The affected creature cannot make an effective attack against any creature bigger than a house cat, but may be able to slip under doors or into cracks and has a 90% chance of moving about undetected (both in terms of sound and vision).\n\n\nPotion of ESP\nThis potion grants the power of the ESP spell.\n\n\nPotion of Extra Healing\nThe imbiber of this potion receives 2d8+2 hit points of healing.\n\n\nPotion of Fire Resistance\nThis potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell resist fire.\n\n\nPotion of Flying\nThis spell grants the power of the spell fly.\n\n\nPotion of Gaseous Form\nThe drinker and all of their gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. They become immune to non-magical weapons and have an Armor Class of 22 against magical weapons. The imbiber can’t attack or cast spells while in gaseous form and loses supernatural abilities. A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, including cracks, as long as the potion persists. However, the gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind and cannot enter water or other liquids. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the potion was imbibed. The drinker cannot resume material form at will but must wait for the potion to expire. Alternatively, the potion may be consumed in thirds, with each dose lasting 1d4+1 turns.\n\n\nPotion of Giant Strength\nThis potion grants the imbiber the Strength of 21. For the duration, the drinker gains a bonus of +5 on attack and damage rolls with melee or thrown weapons, and can throw large stones just as a Stone Giant) can.\n\n\nPotion of Growth\nThe drinker of this potion (with all equipment worn or carried) becomes twice normal height and eight times normal weight. The enlarged character is treated as having the Strength of a Stone Giant (but without the rock-throwing ability), gaining +5 on attack and damage rolls.\n\n\nPotion of Healing\nThe imbiber of this potion receives 1d6+1 hit points of healing (as the spell cure light wounds).\n\n\nPotion of Heroism\nThis potion improves the fighting ability of the drinker. Fighters of less than 3rd level gain +3 to attack bonus as well as gaining 3 hit dice. Fighters of 4th to 5th level gain +2 to attack bonus and 2 hit dice. Fighters of 6th or 7th level gain +1 to attack bonus and 1 hit die. Fighters of 8th level or higher, as well as non-Fighter class characters, gain no hit dice, but still receive +1 to attack bonus. Hit dice gained are only temporary, and damage received is deducted from those hit dice first; any that remain when the potion expires are simply lost.\n\n\nPotion of Invisibility\nThis potion makes the imbiber invisible (as the spell). This potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.\n\n\nPotion of Invulnerability\nThis potion grants a bonus of +2 to Armor Class.\n\n\nKeoghtom’s Ointment\nThis glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease. The ointment will remove scars and reattach knocked out teeth.\n\n\nPotion of Levitation\nThis potion grants the power of the spell levitate.\n\n\nPotion of Longevity\nThe drinker of this potion becomes younger by 1d10 years.\n\n\nPoison\nThis isn’t a potion at all, it’s a trap. The drinker must save vs. Poison or die, even if only a sip was imbibed.\n\n\nPotion of Polymorph Self\nThis potion grants the power of polymorph self spell.\n\n\nPotion of Speed\nThis potion gives the drinker the benefits of the spell haste.\n\n\nPotion of Total Healing\nThe imbiber of this potion is fully restored all hit points lost.\n\n\nPotion of Treasure Finding\nThe imbiber of this potion will immediately know the direction and approximate distance to the largest treasure hoard in a 300’ spherical radius. This potion specifically detects platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper; gemstones and magic items are not detected.\n\n\nPotion of Water Breathing\nThe imbiber breathes underwater as though it was air for 1d6+6 turns.",

    "text": "Scrolls\nMost scrolls contain some sort of magic, which is activated when read, and may only be used once; the characters burn away as the words are read. Spell Scrolls are enchanted with either Cleric (divine) or Magic-User (arcane) spells. Each spell can be used just once, as a scroll immediately disintegrates once it is used.\nOnly a Cleric can use a Clerical scroll, and only a Magic-User can use a Magic-User scroll. The exception to this rule is the thief who, starting at 4th level, has a chance to use an arcane scroll.\nMagic-User scrolls are written in Arcane. If a Magic-User attempts to cast a spell from a scroll that is a higher level than what the Magic-User can cast, a DC check must be made. Roll DC 10 + Int and subtract 2 for each spell level of difference.\nA Magic-User may only transcribe a spell from a scroll or another individual’s spellbook prior to it being used. To copy a spell, the character must spend 1d4 hours per spell level. The chance of successfully transcribing a spell is DC 14 + Int, +1 per level of the Magic-User, -2 per level of the spell. Any failure requires another Magic-User who knows the spell to teach it.\nClerical scrolls are written in a normal language (being just specially enchanted prayers). If a Cleric attempts to cast a spell from a scroll that is a higher level than what the Cleric can cast, a DC check must be made. Roll DC 10 + Wis and subtract 2 for each spell level of difference.\n\nCursed Scroll\nA cursed scroll inflicts some curse upon whoever reads it. It need not be read completely; in fact, merely glancing at the text is enough to inflict the curse. A saving throw may or may not be allowed, as determined by the DM (though a save vs. Spells should usually be allowed). The DM is encouraged to be creative when creating curses; the spell bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) can be used for inspiration, but cursed scrolls can contain more powerful or inventive curses at the DM’s discretion.\n\n\nProtection Scrolls\nProtection Scrolls can be read by any character class, assuming the character can read the language the scroll is written in (see the notes under Language in the Character section for details). When read, a protection scroll creates a 10’ radius protective circle around the reader; preventing the warded creatures from entering. The circle moves with the reader. Any creature other than the sort the scroll wards may enter, including of course the allies of the scroll-reader, who are themselves protected so long as they remain entirely within the circle. If any creature within the circle performs a melee attack against any of the warded creatures, the circle is broken and the warded creatures may freely attack. Normal protection scrolls last for 2 turns after being read.\n\n\nProtection from Magic\nProtection from Magic scrolls are special, as they protect against magic spells and items rather than creatures. No magical effect can cross the 10’ circle of protection in either direction for 1d4 turns. As with the other protection scrolls, the circle created by this scroll moves with the reader.\n\n\nTreasure Maps\nTreasure Maps are generally non-magical. They must be created by the DM, although he or she may delay creating the map until the characters can actually use it. The treasure indicated on the map will normally be guarded by some sort of monster, determined by the DM as desired.",

    "section": "Rings",
    "text": "Rings\nA ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than one ring per hand) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).\n\nRing of Control Animal\nThe wearer of this ring can charm up to 6 hit dice of animals. The effect works much like a charm person spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals, but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the power at will, targeting any animal within 60’ that he or she can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\n\n\nRing of Control Human\nThe wearer of this ring may cast the spell charm person at any target he or she can see within 60’. The wearer can use this power once per round, at will, but cannot control more than 6 hit dice of creatures at a time; however, the wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\n\n\nRing of Control Plant\nThe wearer of this ring may create an effect equivalent to a potion of plant control) at will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60’ that he or she can see. The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60’ of the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.\n\n\nRing of Delusion\nThis ring appears to be some other sort of ring (roll on the rings table to determine what sort). Whoever wears it believes it is working, and behaves thus (so a character who believes he is wearing a ring of invisibility will believe himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the same name, the ring’s effect is not dispelled by the wearer taking damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this cursed item is with the spell remove curse.\n\n\nRing of Djinni Summoning\nThis ring serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed, the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes non-magical and worthless.\n\n\nRing of Eibon\nThe wearer can spend 3 charges to Misty Step.\nThe ring is made of an amber gold and set with a large purple gem, somber and smoldering, of which the like is not easily found in the OnceWas.\n\n\nRing of Fire Resistance\nThe wearer of this ring receives protection as the spell resist fire, but the protection works continually.\n\n\nRing of Free Action\nThis ring enables the wearer to move and attack freely and normally even when attacked by a web, hold, or slow spell, or even while under water. The spells simply have no effect. While under water, the individual moves at normal (surface) speed and does full damage even with cutting weapons (like axes and scimitars) and with smashing weapons (like flails, hammers, and maces), insofar as the weapon used is held rather than hurled. This will not, however, enable breathing under water without further appropriate magic.\n\n\nRing of Invisibility\nBy activating this simple silver ring, the wearer becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, including Darkvision. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.\nLight, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).\nIf the invisibility is dispelled if the wearer attacks any creature or casts any spell. Actions (other than spell casting) directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Once dispelled, the ring may not be reactivated for one full turn.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThis ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a bonus to the Armor Class of the wearer (varying from +1 to +3). This bonus is also applied to the wearer’s saving throw die rolls.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nThis ring grants the wearer the power of regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the troll, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire damage. However, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.\n\n\nRing of Second Chances\nThis diamond ring with a platinum band allows (once per day) the user to reroll any dice roll and keep the higher roll.\n\n\nRing of Shooting Stars\nThis gold ring generally has 2d10 charges. 1 to 3 charges can be expended as an action. For every charge expended, a glowing mote of light is launched from the ring at a visible target at a point you within 60 feet. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks for 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n\nRing of Spell Storing\nA ring of spell storing contains a number of spells (either divine or arcane) that any wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. Any class may wear and use this ring, but it can only be recharged by a spell caster casting the appropriate spell into it.\nA table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what levels they are. A ring of spell storing must be recharged with the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a ring of two spell storing containing fireball and fly can only be recharged with those two spells. The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells stored within it.\nA ring found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged, at the DM’s option.\n\n\n\nd%\n# of Spells\nd%\nLevel of Spell\n\n\n\n\n01-24\n1\n01-30\n1st\n\n\n25-48\n2\n31-55\n2nd\n\n\n49-67\n3\n56-75\n3rd\n\n\n68-81\n4\n76-85\n4th\n\n\n82-91\n5\n86-97\n5th\n\n\n92-96\n6\n98-00\n6th\n\n\n97-00\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing of Spell Turning\nThis ring reflects spells cast directly at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a hold person spell would be reflected, but not a fireball. It will reflect up to 2d10 spells levels before its power is exhausted.\n\n\nRing of Telekinesis\nThe wearer of this ring can move objects or creatures by concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 600 pounds can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray.\nIn order to use this power, the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.\nThe effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.\n\n\nRing of Water Walking\nThis ring allows the wearer to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the wearer’s feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since he or she is still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.\n\n\nRing of Weakness\nWhoever puts this ring on is cursed; his or her Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The ring can only be removed with remove curse.\n\n\nRing of Wishes\nA ring of wishes contains the power to grant wishes to the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is found. The DM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Dungeon Master  section regarding this.\n\n\nRing of X-Ray Vision\nOn command, this ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead or gold blocks the vision. The ring may be used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn (or until the wearer ceases to concentrate upon it).",

    "section": "Wands, Staves and Rods",
    "text": "Wands, Staves and Rods\nWands A wand is a short stick, generally 12 to 18 inches long, imbued with the power to cast a specific spell or spell-like effect. A newly created wand has 20 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges. A wand found in a treasure hoard will have 2d10 charges remaining. If a wand generates an effect equivalent to a spell, assume the spell functions as if cast by a 6th level caster, or the lowest level caster who could cast that spell (whichever is higher), unless otherwise noted. Wands are generally usable only by Magic-Users. Saving throws are rolled as normal but use the Magic Wands column rather than the Spells column.\nStaves A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 30 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges. A staff found in a treasure hoard will have 3d10 charges remaining. Spell effects generated by a staff operate at 8th level, or the lowest caster level the spell could be cast by, whichever is higher, unless otherwise stated. Staves are usable only by Magic-Users, except where noted. Saving throws against magic from a staff are rolled on the Spells column.\nRods A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell. Rods are normally usable by any class.\n\nRod of Cancellation\nThis dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. If the item is held by a creature, an attack roll is needed to touch it. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a wish.\n\n\nSnake Staff\nThis item is a walking staff +1. When used by a Cleric, the user may command the staff to transform into a constrictor snake (instead of causing damage) on a successful hit. The snake will wrap around a target up to man-sized and hold them fast for 1d4 turns, unless a save vs. Spells is made. The snake does not attack in any other way, nor cause any damage. The snake may be recalled by the user at any point, in which case it returns to their hand and reverts to staff form. It also returns in this way when the duration expires, or if the save is made. The snake has Armor Class 15, moves 20’ per round, and has 20 hit points; any hit points of damage taken are healed completely when the snake returns to staff form. If killed in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into a broken stick. The staff may be used any number of times per day and neither has nor uses charges.\n\n\nStaff of Commanding\nThis staff can cast charm person and charm monster spells, and can grant a power equivalent to a potion of control plant. Each function uses one charge.\n\n\nStaff of Healing\nThis staff can heal 1d6+1 hit points per charge expended, as the spell cure light wounds. Alternately, with an expenditure of two charges, the staff can cast cure disease. This staff is only usable by a Cleric.\n\n\nStaff of Life\nThe staff is made of white oak and carved to resemble braided bands of holly and oak boughs, twisted around a unicorn’s horn at the end. It has 7 charges. Only a Cleric or Paladin can only wield this staff.\nHeal Spell (per 1 charge)\nHeal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue, feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all but 1d4 of the target’s hit points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.\nResurrection (per 5 charges)\nThis restores life to a deceased creature. A creature can be raised that has been dead for no longer than 6 months. The full body is not required; only a small portion is required, but that portion must have been part of the subject’s body at the time of death. (The dust left from a disintegrate spell counts as the required small portion.) A whole new body is created, so it will be at the peak of health, with full hit points, and all spells prepared at the time of death.\nThis is still an ordeal, however. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is resurrected, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.\nA creature which has become undead can be resurrected as long as the undead creature has been destroyed. Constructs and elementals cannot be resurrected.\nThis item cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.\n\n\nStaff of Power\nThis is a very potent magic item, with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers costing one charge per use: lightning bolt(6d6 damage), fireball (6d6 damage), cone of cold (as the wand, for 6d6 damage), continual light, and telekinesis (as the ring, lasting at most 1d6 turns). The staff is also a +2 walking staff, and can be used exactly as a staff of striking.\nA staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30’ radius, doing 1d6 damage per charge remaining (save vs. Spells for half damage). All within the area, including the wielder, are affected by this.\nAfter all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 walking staff. Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.\n\n\nStaff of Storm Clouds\nThis wooden staff is carved with the images of rolling thunderclouds. It emits the smell of ozone, and while holding it, you can hear the faint rumble of distant storm clouds within.\nGust of Wind (1 charge) Range: 10 ft. x 50 yds, Duration: 5 rounds The force of this gust of wind (about 30 m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames—such as those of lanterns—to dance wildly and has a 25% chance to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind’s movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level magic-user causes a gust of wind that travels 80 yards).\nForked Lightning (2 charges) Range: 50 feet Three arcs of electricity spring from the staff to strike separate targets within 20 feet of each other. For each bolt, the wielder must roll to hit their chosen target, ignoring any worn armor; metal-armored targets get a +4 bonus to hit (any magical bonuses still apply). Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by this spell. Each bolt deals 1d6 + 2 points of electricity damage. If there are fewer than the maximum allowed targets, then the extra bolts do not appear and are wasted; a single bolt can only strike a single creature. There is no save to resist the spell once struck by a bolt, but creatures with any sort of resistance to electrical attacks will suffer no damage whatsoever.\nThunderstrike (3 charges) Range: 150 feet, Duration: 5 rounds The wielder calls down a 5-foot wide, 30-foot long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell’s range (measured from the caster’s position at the time of casting). Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs. Spells reduces damage taken by half. All within a 60-foot area must make a second save against paralyzation or be deafened for 1d6 turns.\nIce Storm (4 charges) Range: 450 feet, Duration: 1 round The staff causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1 full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a 30-foot radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40 feet, so creatures higher than that distance above the target spot are unaffected. A -20% penalty applies to each Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its save).\n\n\nStaff of Striking\nThis staff has no attack bonus, but is treated as a +1 weapon with respect to what sorts of monsters it can hit (and is usable by any class in that mode). This staff’s primary power may only be used if wielded by a Cleric: By uttering a command word, the Cleric may create an effect similar to the spell striking. Expenditure of one charge adds 1d6 damage to the weapon’s next strike; expenditure of two charges adds 2d6, and expenditure of three charges adds 3d6 damage. If the weapon is not successfully used after the command word has been spoken, the effect dissipates after one turn.\n\n\nStaff of Traveling and Leaping\nThis staff increases the wearer’s base land speed by an additional 10’ per round. In addition to this traveling ability, the staff allows the bearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10’ high and/or 30’ across.\n\n\nStaff of Withering\nThe staff functioned as a +2 quarterstaff. On a successful hit a charge can be expended to deal 2d10 +2 necrotic damage to the target. In addition, the target ages 10 years (save versus Wands for half).\n\n\nStaff of Wizardry\nThis staff is equivalent to the Staff of Power, above, and has the following powers as well: invisibility, passwall, web, and conjure elementals These powers each use one charge when activated.\n\n\nQuarterstaff of the Abbot\nThis staff appears as a normal, unadorned wooden quarterstaff +1, but when the weapon is used in combat, it endows its possessor with one of the following attacks or feats:\nSunder - On a successful hit, a man-sized opponent must save versus a DC 14 + Dexterity or have their non-magical weapon destroyed.\nTrip - On a successful hit, a man-sized opponent must save versus a DC 14 + Dexterity or be tripped.\nDisarm - On a successful hit, a man-sized opponent must save versus a DC 14 + Dexterity or be disarmed.\nImproved Parry and Dodge - This is a defensive action instead of an attack that gives a +3 bonus to AC.\n\n\nWand of Cold\nThis wand generates a conical blast of cold doing 6d8 damage (save vs. Magic Wands for half damage). The cone spreads from the tip of the wand to a width of 30’ at a distance of 40’ away.\n\n\nWand of Enemy Detection\nThe effect of this wand is to make all enemies of the user within 60’ glow with a greenish white light for one round. Even hidden or invisible enemies glow in this way, revealing them, but enemies completely out of sight (such as behind a wall) may not be seen by the user. An “enemy” is any creature which is thinking of or otherwise intending to harm the user; also, all undead monsters and animated constructs within range will glow in this way regardless of intent or thoughts (or lack thereof).\n\n\nWand of Fear\nThis wand generates the effect of the spell cause fear (the reverse of the spell remove fear).\n\n\nWand of Fireballs\nThis wand generates fireball’s, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.\n\n\nWand of Illusion\nThis wand allows the user to create illusions equivalent to the spell phantasmal force.\n\n\nWand of Lightning Bolts\nThis wand generates lightning bolts, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.\n\n\nWand of Magic Detection\nThis wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell detect magic.\n\n\nWand of Paralyzation\nThis wand creates the effect of the spell hold person.\n\n\nWand of Polymorph\nThis wand can be used to cast either polymorph self or polymorph other.\n\n\nWand of Secret Door Detection\nThis wand grants the user a power similar to the spell find traps, but which reveals secret doors rather than traps.\n\n\nWand of Trap Detection\nThis wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell find traps.\n\n\nWand of Viscid Globs\nThis metallic baton works with a command word (“Híw”—Elven for sticky) and may be used by any class. The wand shoots bright greenish goo that covers a 5 ft area. (Save vs. Wands)\nEffect: The goo hardens rapidly when it comes into contact with air. If it splashes over a creature, it can effectively glue that being to the ground. If cast upon a flying creature, it hardens around the wings and prevents flight. The goo does not harden underwater; it requires contact with air. It does not cause those caught within it to suffocate.\nStrength: The adhesive is so strong that a creature could break their joints before the bonds, causing less intelligent creatures to possibly destroy themselves in their attempt to free themselves.\nDuration: The hardened goo eventually becomes brittle in 2d6 turns and cracks apart. The substance can also be dissolved by alcohol, such as that in wine.\nWeakness: This drow wand is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for an hour.",

    "title": "27  Magical Items",
    "section": "Miscellaneous Items",
    "text": "Miscellaneous Items\nThese items may take any of several forms, and have a variety of effects; when randomly rolled, the effect is determined first (as explained with the tables above) and then the form is rolled on a separate table. Generally, such an item is written as a [Form] of [Effect], for example, a Cloak of Fire Resistance.\nItems with forms meant to be worn are limited in that only a normal number may be used at one time: at most two rings (one on each hand), one cloak, a pair of boots, one helm, and one pendant. If a character is wearing two items that grant the same continuous effect, such as Cold Resistance or Protection, only one such item will function. If the items have differing levels of effect, such as a Cloak of Protection +1 and a Ring of Protection +3, only the more powerful item will operate (in this case, the ring).\nWhile the tables on page 167 provide standard forms for miscellaneous items, the Dungeon Master is in no way limited to what appears on the Form of Item table; items may be created with forms not normally allowed there, or indeed even in forms that are not there at all.\n\nMiscellaneous Item Effects\nBlasting: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), it creates a powerful blast of sound filling a cone 10’ long and 2’ wide at the base. Those within the area of effect suffer 2d6 points of damage and are deafened for 1 full turn. A successful saving throw vs. Death Ray reduces damage by half and reduces the period of deafness to a single round.\nThe device can also be used to damage or destroy buildings, fortifications, etc. Double the damage listed above when this item is used against a structure. The Stronghold rules in the Dungeon Master section contains further guidance on this.\nBlending: The wearer of this item becomes nearly invisible, granting an 80% chance that the wearer can move about unnoticed. If detected by onlookers, the wearer can be attacked without significant penalty.\nCold Resistance: The wearer of this device receives protection as the spell resist cold, but the protection works continually.\nComprehension: The wearer of this device is granted the ability to read any language, including any form of magical script. Being able to read magic does not confer magical abilities upon the wearer, but if worn by a magic-user it grants the effects of read magic constantly. Note that when reading non-magical texts, the limitations described under the spell read languages apply to this device also.\nControl Animal: The wearer of this device can charm up to 6 hit dice of animals. The effect works much like a charm person spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals, but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the power at will, targeting any animal within 60’ that they can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\nControl Human: The wearer of this device may cast the spell charm person at any target they can see within 60’. The wearer can use this power once per round, at will. If more than one humanoid is to be affected, the wearer cannot control more than 6 hit dice or levels of humanoids at a time; however, the wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice or levels to control a new target.\nControl Plant: The wearer of this device may create an effect equivalent to a Potion of Plant Control at will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60’ that they can see. The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60’ of the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.\nCourage: When this device is played, all characters and creatures friendly to the user within 60 feet are affected as by the spell remove fear.\nDeception: This device grants to the wearer the power of the Deceiver (as described on page 75). Any attacker will believe the wearer is 3 feet from their true location, and the attacker’s first strike will always miss. Thereafter, the attacker suffers a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls. This ring does not affect mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or any sort of undead. Living creatures which are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to target the wearer.\nDelusion: Whoever wears this device believes it is some other form of useful magical device, and behaves thus (so for example, if Evron believes he is wearing a Ring of Invisibility he will believe himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the same name, the device’s effect is not dispelled by the wearer suffering damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this cursed item is with the spell remove curse.\nDjinni Summoning: Each device of this type has a specific djinni bound to it, which will be summoned to the wearer’s location when they rub the device while wearing it. The djinni appears in the next round and protects, serves, and obeys the wearer. The djinni will serve at most 1 hour per day, and can be summoned at most once per day. If the djinni bound to a device is ever slain, the ring loses all magical properties.\nDoom: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), this device will create animated skeletons or zombies as if by the spell animate dead. Up to 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters will be so created from remains within a 60’ radius of the character who activated the device. If both skeletal and fleshy remains are available in the area of effect, skeletons will be animated in preference over zombies. If the user is a magic-user or cleric, the created undead may be controlled so long as that character retains the device. If played by a fighter or thief, the undead created will be uncontrolled, and will attack any living creatures nearby. The device may be used once per day, but no more than 18 hit dice of undead created by it may exist at any one time.\nFire Resistance: The wearer of this device receives protection as the spell resist fire, but the protection works continually.\nInvisibility: The wearer of this device can become invisible (as the spell invisibility) on command. If the invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the device may not be reactivated for one full turn. The invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours. Levitation: The wearer of this device may levitate (as the spell) at will by concentrating. There is no limit to how long this device may be used.\nMind Reading: Whoever wears this device has access to a permanent form of the spell ESP; it is always available but only activates when the wearer spends a full round concentrating upon it, and persists until the wearer ceases to use it. The effect can be activated as many times per day as the wearer wants.\nPanic: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), all creatures more than 20 feet from the user but not over 120 feet away must save vs. Spells or be affected as by the spell cause fear.\nPenetrating Vision: On command, and for so long thereafter that the wearer concentrates on it, this device confers the power to see through solid matter as if it were transparent as glass. The effect extends at most 20 feet, and the wearer sees as if in normal light even if they are in fact in total darkness.\nThis effect is blocked by certain materials; the wearer can see through at most 3 feet of wood or soil, 1 foot of stone, or 1 inch of most metals. Gold or lead no thicker than foil will completely block the effect.\nThe device may be used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn.\nProtection: The wearer of an item with this power receives the listed benefit (from +1 to +3) to their Armor Class for so long as the ring is worn. This bonus is also applied to the wearer’s saving throw die rolls.\nProtection from Energy Drain: This device has the power to absorb and neutralize energy-draining attacks, death spells or effects (such as slay living), and curses that would otherwise affect the wearer. The device has 2d6 charges when found, and each negative level, curse, or spell absorbed consumes one charge. When the device’s charges are exhausted it disintegrates into golden sparkles and disappears.\nProtection from Scrying: The wearer of this item is immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and any other means of location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of mind reading/ESP. Other characters who are within 30’ of the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind reading\nRegeneration: This device grants the wearer the power of regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the Troll on page 151, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire damage. Note that this device will only heal damage suffered while it is worn; pre-existing damage is not healed by putting on the device.\nScrying: This device can be used to spy upon other people or locations, regardless of distance. A scrying device may only be used by Magic-Users. It can be used three times per day, for up to a turn each time. The chance of success when using a scrying device is as shown below. Total chances equal to or greater than 100% do not require a roll.\n\n\n\nKnowledge and Connection\nChance\n\n\n\n\nSecondhand Knowledge (heard of)\n25%\n\n\nFirsthand Knowledge (seen briefly)\n55%\n\n\nFamiliar (known well)\n95%\n\n\nPossession or garment\n+25%\n\n\nBody part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.\n+50%\n\n\n\nThe user of the device is the only one who will see the image. No sound will be heard normally. Detect magic, detect evil, and ESP have a 3% chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if used with a scrying device.\nScrying, Superior: This item works exactly like a standard scrying device, as described above, but also allows the user to hear any sounds in the location viewed as if they were there.\nSpeed: The wearer of this device can activate it with a command word (or by clicking their heels together, if the item takes the form of boots) and gain the effect of a haste spell, and can end the effect the same way. The effect can be used for a total of 10 rounds each day.\nSpell Storing: These much sought-after devices each contain a number of spells which can be cast by the wearer. Most of them contain Magic-User spells, but 1 in 10 contains Clerical spells instead. No device may contain spells of both types! Each spell stored in the device is cast as if by the lowest-level character who could normally cast the spell, but not less than 6th level in any case.\nAny class may wear and use this device, but it can only be recharged by casting the appropriate spell into it. A table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what levels they are. A spell storing device must be recharged with the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a Pendant of Two Spell Storing containing fireball and fly can only be recharged with those two spells.\nThe wearer of one of these devices automatically knows the names of the spells stored within it, but is not granted detailed knowledge of how each spell works. If the wearer is not a magic-user and no such character is available to advise the wearer, there may be some difficulty in using it successfully (and safely).\nA device of this type found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged, at the DM’s option.\n\n\n\nd%\nno of Spells\nd%\nLevel of Spell\n\n\n\n\n01-24\n1\n01-30\n1st\n\n\n25-48\n2\n31-55\n2nd\n\n\n49-67\n3\n56-75\n3rd\n\n\n68-81\n4\n76-85\n4th\n\n\n82-91\n5\n86-97\n5th\n\n\n92-96\n6\n98-00\n6th\n\n\n97-00\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Turning: This device reflects spells cast directly at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a hold person spell would be reflected, but not a fireball. It will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its power is exhausted.\nStealth: The wearer of this device can move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a 90% chance of success when moving silently (as the Thief ability of the same name).\nTelekinesis: The wearer of this device can use the power of the spell telekinesis, as if cast by a 12th level Magic-User. The effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.\nTelepathy: Three times per day this item can be activated by use of its command word, at which point it will grant the wearer the power of a special version of the ESP spell which has a range of 90 feet and lasts for 1 turn. During this time the wearer can send thoughts to the mind of any creature whose thoughts the wearer is already reading, allowing communication.\nTeleportation: Upon command the wearer of this item may cast the spell teleportation as if by a wizard of the 12th level of ability. This power can be used up to 3 times per day.\nTrue Seeing: Three times per day this device can grant the user the power of the spell true seeing. Each use lasts at most one turn.\nWater Walking: This device allows the wearer to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the wearer’s feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since they are still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.\nWeakness: Whoever puts this device on is cursed; their Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The device can only be removed with remove curse.\nWishes: This device contains the power to grant wishes to the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is found. The DM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Dungeon Master  section regarding this.",

    "text": "Rare Items\n\nAbyssal Horn\nAny demons who hear this amber horn blown must make a DC 14 + Cha save or be banished to their plane of origin.\nIf this is blown on the demon’s native plane, demons within 60 ft. take 6d6 points of damage instead. Once this horn is used, it cannot be used again for 3d4 days.\n\n\nAmulet of Proof against Detection and Location\nThe wearer of this item is immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and any other means of location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of mind reading (such as the spell ESP). Other characters who remain within 30’ of the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind reading.\n\n\nApparatus of the Crab\nThis item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\nArmor Class: 20\nHit Points: 200\nSpeed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)\nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.\n\nApparatus of the Crab Levers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLever\nUp\nDown\n\n\n\n\n1\nLegs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.\nLegs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus’s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.\n\n\n2\nForward window shutter opens.\nForward window shutter closes.\n\n\n3\nSide window shutters open (two per side).\nSide window shutters close (two per side).\n\n\n4\nTwo claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.\nThe claws retract.\n\n\n5\nEach extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.\nEach extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15).\n\n\n6\nThe apparatus walks or swims forward.\nThe apparatus walks or swims backward.\n\n\n7\nThe apparatus turns 90 degrees left.\nThe apparatus turns 90 degrees right.\n\n\n8\nEyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.\nThe light turns off.\n\n\n9\nThe apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid.\nThe apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.\n\n\n10\nThe rear hatch unseals and opens.\nThe rear hatch closes and seals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBag of Devouring\nThis device appears, to all tests, to be a normal Bag of Holding, and in fact it performs exactly like one at first. However, all items placed within disappear forever 1d6+6 turns later. The bag continues to weigh whatever it did after the items were placed within it (that is, one-tenth the total weight of the items), until it is opened and discovered to be empty.\n\n\nBag of Holding\nThis device is a bag which appears to be about 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. It opens into an extradimensional space and is able to hold more than should be possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up to 70 cubic feet of volume. The bag weighs one-tenth as much as the total of the objects held within. Any object to be stored in the bag must fit through the opening, which has a circumference of 4 feet.\nPuncturing or tearing the bag will destroy its magic and cause all contents to be lost forever. If this item is turned inside out all contents are dumped. The bag is unharmed, but it will no longer work until it is turned right side out again. If living creatures are placed inside they will suffocate within a turn (with exceptions for creatures resistant to suffocation as determined by the DM). The bag’s volume cannot be overfilled (as excess items simply cannot be put inside), but if overloaded above 500 pounds and then lifted it will be torn.\nGetting any particular item from the bag requires the bearer to spend a round searching during which no movement may be made.\n\n\nBelt of Silver Pine Cones\nThis black leather belt has a dozen silver pine cone charms hanging from it.\nIt provides the wearer with a +3 to hit and +3 AC bonus when in combat with plants , +3 saving throws from plant based attacks.\n\n\nBoots of Levitation\nOn command, these leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if by the spell of the same name.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nThe wearer of these boots can click their boot heels together, thus activating a haste spell effect for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the haste effect need not be consecutive rounds; the boots can be turned off and on as desired.\n\n\nBoots of Stonehold\nThis footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer.\n\nFirst, the wearer is able to travel across snow at his normal speed, leaving no tracks.\nThe boots also enable travel at normal speed across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping.\nFinally, boots of Stonehold warm the wearer, as if he were affected by a Resist Cold spell\n\n\n\nBoots of Traveling and Leaping\nThese boots allow the wearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10 feet high and/or 30 feet across. They improve the wearer’s movement so greatly that they also increase their movement rate on land by an additional 10 feet per round.\n\n\nBowl Commanding Water Elementals\nThis large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a water elemental appears and follows the commands of the summoned. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.\n\n\nBowl of Purification\nActs like the Purify Food and Water spell. Any food placed in this large ornate bowl will be made pure and suitable for eating and drinking, even if it is spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated. The bowl does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions. The bowl can be used twice per day.\n\n\nBrazier Commanding Fire Elementals\nThis device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a fire elemental appears and follows the commands of the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.\n\n\nBrooch of Shielding\nThis magical gold pin absorbs 101 hit point of magic missile damage\n\n\nBroom of Flying\nThis broom is able to fly through the air for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as he or she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when the command word is spoken.\n\n\nCenser Commanding Air Elementals\nThis 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth an air elemental which follows the commands of the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.\n\n\nCirclet of the Abyss\nThe Circlet of the Abyss is a platinum piece of headwear that seems to radiate evil and has the following properties:\n\nDemon Blood Shielding. The Circlet creates an invisible, shield-like force around of the wearer. It negates magic missile attacks, and improves the caster’s Armor Class by +3.\nEyes of evil. Darkvision 60 ft. and can see invisible creatures.\nVeil of Evil. The wearer of the circlet is immune to Hold, Charm, Fear and Sleep Spells, and unaffected by Silence.\nFamiliar. The wearer can summon a quasit to serve them.\nCurse. The wearer will become darker and more evil the longer they wear the circlet. Holy water deals 1d8 points of damage. Demons will begin whispering to them in dreams.\n\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nThis item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves, causing the wearer’s apparent location to shift around constantly over a range of 3’ from their true location. The first melee or missile attack by any creature against the wearer will miss, and all further attacks by that attacker are made with an attack penalty of -2. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.\n\n\nCrystal Ball\nThis is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. They may only be used by Magic-Users, who can use the device to see over virtually any distance. A crystal ball can be used three times per day, for up to one turn each time.\nThe chance of success when using a crystal ball is as shown below. Total chances equal to or greater than 100% do not require a roll.\n\n\n\nKnowledge and Connection\nChance\n\n\n\n\nSecondhand Knowledge (heard of)\n25%\n\n\nFirsthand Knowledge (seen briefly)\n55%\n\n\nFamiliar (known well)\n95%\n\n\nPossession or garment\n+25%\n\n\nBody part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.\n+50%\n\n\n\nThe user of the crystal ball is the only one who will see the image. No sound will be heard normally. Detect magic, detect evil, and ESP have a 3% chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if used with a crystal ball.\n\n\nCubic Gate\nThis wondrous, legendary cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different Outer plane of existence.\nYou can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.\n\nThe cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPlanar Connections:\n\nMaterial Plane (OnceWas)\nAstral Sea\nThe Elemental Plane of Fire\nThe Elemental Plane of Water\nThe Elemental Plane of Air\nThe Elemental Plane of Earth\n\n\n\nDecanter of Endless Water\nFresh water pours out of the flask when the stopper is removed and one of the command words is spoken. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:\n\n“Stream” produces 1 gallon of water.\n“Fountain” produces 5 gallons of water.\n“Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.\n“Flood” produces a continuous flow that can only be stopped by the user speaking the command word again.\n\n\n\nCrystal Ball with Clairaudience\nThis item works exactly like the standard crystal ball, above, but also allows the user to hear any sounds in the location viewed as if they were there.\n\n\nDrums of Panic\nThese drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures with fewer than 6 hit dice within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot radius safe zone around the drums) must save vs. Spells or flee in fear. The drums can be used once per day.\n\n\nDust of Disappearance\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become Invisible for 2d12 rounds.\n\n\nEfreeti Bottle\nThis item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals; or, it may be a lamp made of brass. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly and the DM rolls a d% to determine what happens.\n\nThere is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released.\nThere is also a 10% chance (11–20) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes.\nIn either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever.\nThe other 80% of the time (21–100), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to an hour per day for 101 days (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as the character commands. After 101 days have passed, the efreeti is freed from service and may return to its extradimensional home.\n\nRoll only the first time the bottle is opened (or the DM may choose which sort of bottle is found as desired).\n\n\nElven Boots\nThese soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a DC 9 (- Dex bonus) chance of success (Like a 8th level Thief).\n\n\nElven Cloak\nThis cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, it gives the wearer a +5 bonus on Hide checks.\n\n\nFolding Boat\nThis object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words: étoc, knarr, κουτί, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.\n\nThe command word étoc causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four humanoid sized creatures comfortably.\nThe command word knarr causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen humanoid sized creatures comfortably.\nThe command word κουτί causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.\n\nWhen the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.\n\n\nFlying Carpet\nThis rug is able to fly through the air on command. A flying carpet is typically 5’ x 8’ in size and can carry up to 500 pounds at a movement rate of 100’ per round, or up to 1000 pounds (its maximum capacity) at a rate of 50’ per round. A flying carpet can fly at any speed up to its maximum, and can hover on command.\n\n\nGauntlets of Ogre Power\nThese gauntlets are made of tough leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer a Strength bonus of +4 (instead of their own Strength bonus). Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.\n\n\nGloves of Arrow Snaring\nThe wearer of these gloves has a chance to catch arrows, bolts, or stones fired from a ranged weapon that would normally hit. The challenge is (DC 9 + Dex). There is no damage from a successful catch. Both gloves must be worn and at least one hand must be free for the magic to be effective.\n\n\nGirdle of Giant Strength\nThis item grants the wearer the Strength of a giant. For so long as it is worn, the wearer gains a Strength bonus of +5 (instead of their own Strength bonus), and can throw large stones just as a stone giant does.\n\n\nGoggles of the Night\nThis item, when worn, allows Darkvision with a 60-foot range and can detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls, and new construction on a Difficulty Challenge (DC) of 14; a search must be performed before this roll may be made.\n\n\nHannelore’s Coat of Arms\nThis leather coat with four sleeves allows the wearer to summon and control a second set of arms identical to their own arms once per day for 3 turns. The penalty for fighting with multiple arms is -2 to hit with both primary hands and -5 with both secondary hands.\n\n\nHelm of Reading Languages and Magic\nAppearing as a normal helmet, this helm grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language, including magical writing. The wearer of this helm can also use arcane scrolls with the same proficiency as a 7th-level thief (DC 7).\n\n\nHelm of Telepathy\nThe wearer can read the surface thoughts of a target creature within 90 feet, similar to the spell ESP. Additionally, the wearer can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts are being read, enabling two-way communication. This helm can be used up to three times per day.\n\n\nHelm of Teleportation\nA character wearing this device may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he or she had cast the spell of the same name.\n\n\nHorn of Blasting\nThis horn resembles a normal trumpet in appearance. It can function as a standard horn, but when a command word is spoken and the instrument is played, it unleashes a blast. Creatures within a cone 40 feet long and 40 feet wide at the far end take 2d6 points of damage and are deafened for 2d6 rounds. Affected creatures can make a saving throw vs. Death Ray for half damage and to avoid deafness. Crystalline creatures take double damage, while nonliving creatures are immune to deafness but still suffer damage.\nIf the horn of blasting is magically used more than once in a day, there is a cumulative 10% chance with each additional use that it explodes, dealing 3d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.\nThe horn can also be used to damage or destroy buildings, fortifications, etc., doubling the damage dealt when used against structures.\n\n\nHorn of Doom\nWhen blown, this horn has the effect of the spell animate dead, creating animated skeletons or zombies from remains within a 60-foot radius of the user. Up to 3d6 hit dice worth of undead creatures can be animated by the horn. If both skeletal and fleshy remains are present, skeletons are animated preferentially over zombies.\nIf the user is a magic-user or cleric, they can control the undead created as long as they possess the horn. If blown by a fighter or thief, the undead created will be uncontrolled and hostile, attacking any nearby living creatures.\nThe horn may be used once per day, but no more than 18 hit dice worth of undead creatures created by the horn can exist simultaneously.\n\n\nIncense of Oghma\nBurning a cone of this powerful incense and meditating for 1 hour, enables a spell caster to memorize 3 additional spell levels.\nExample: +3 first level spells, or +1 first level and +1 second level, or +1 third level spell\n\n\nMagical Deep Pocket\nThis belt pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, including objects up to four feet long, though anything placed into it needs to fit through the opening of a normal-sized belt pouch. It always weighs one pound, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the pocket follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from it requires you to use an action. When you reach into the pocket for a specific item, that item magically appears on top.\nThe deep pocket has a few limitations: - Overloading it or piercing it with a sharp object destroys it. - If destroyed, its contents are lost forever, though an artifact lost this way may reappear elsewhere. - Turning it inside out spills its contents unharmed; it must be corrected before use.\nIf a living creature is placed within the pocket, it can survive for up to 10 minutes before beginning to suffocate. Placing the deep pocket inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items, creating a gate to the Astral Sea. The gate opens where one item was placed inside the other. Creatures within 10 feet of the gate are drawn through and deposited randomly on the Astral Sea before the gate closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened.\n\n\nMedallion of ESP\nThis pendant disk, typically made from bronze, copper, or nickel and worn on a neck chain, allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, similar to the spell ESP. The medallion can be used as many times per day as desired. However, each use requires at least 1 round of full concentration to activate, and the wearer must maintain concentration to sustain the effect.\n\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nThis magical device appears as a large mirror of various styles, framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and activated by speaking a command word followed by “activate” or “deactivate.” Only a Magic-User can properly control this device. The same command word deactivates the mirror, and the character who activated it is immune to its effects.\nThe mirror contains twenty metaphysical cells within it. Any character or creature standing within 30 feet of the mirror and viewing their reflection must make a save vs. Spells or be drawn bodily into the mirror, along with all items worn or carried. Size is not a factor for those trapped, but undead, constructs, and creatures lacking eyes are immune to its effects.\nTrapped creatures become mere reflections within the mirror, unable to take actions. The controlling character can summon the reflection of any trapped creature by speaking the command word followed by the number of the cell containing the reflection. The trapped creature can speak and move within the mirror but cannot cast spells or take tangible actions.\nThe controlling character may interrogate the trapped victim, although the mirror does not compel truthfulness. To return the trapped creature to its cell, the controller speaks the command word followed by “return.” Alternatively, the command word followed by “come out” frees the victim, who appears beside the controller.\nIf all cells are occupied when a new creature is trapped, one cell chosen at random is emptied to accommodate the new arrival. If the mirror is broken, all trapped victims are instantly freed from its confines.\n\n\nPortable Hole\nThis fine black cloth, as soft as silk, is folded to the dimensions of a handkerchief. When unfolded, it forms a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, creating an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within exists on a different plane and cannot be used to create passages. Creatures inside an open portable hole can exit by climbing out.\nClosing the portable hole requires using an action to fold the cloth. Any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. The hole weighs next to nothing regardless of its contents.\nIf the hole is folded while a creature is inside its extradimensional space, the creature can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to force its way out. On a successful check, the creature appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes before beginning to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, magical deep pocket, or similar item instantly destroys both items, opening a gate to the Astral Sea where the items were intermingled. Creatures within 10 feet of the gate are drawn through to a random location on the Astral Sea, after which the gate closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened.\n\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nThis magical device appears as a large mirror of various styles, framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and activated by speaking a command word followed by “activate” or “deactivate.” Only a Magic-User can properly control this device. The same command word deactivates the mirror, and the character who activated it is immune to its effects.\nThe mirror contains twenty metaphysical cells within it. Any character or creature standing within 30 feet of the mirror and viewing their reflection must make a save vs. Spells or be drawn bodily into the mirror, along with all items worn or carried. Size is not a factor for those trapped, but undead, constructs, and creatures lacking eyes are immune to its effects.\nTrapped creatures become mere reflections within the mirror, unable to take actions. The controlling character can summon the reflection of any trapped creature by speaking the command word followed by the number of the cell containing the reflection. The trapped creature can speak and move within the mirror but cannot cast spells or take tangible actions.\nThe controlling character may interrogate the trapped victim, although the mirror does not compel truthfulness. To return the trapped creature to its cell, the controller speaks the command word followed by “return.” Alternatively, the command word followed by “come out” frees the victim, who appears beside the controller.\nIf all cells are occupied when a new creature is trapped, one cell chosen at random is emptied to accommodate the new arrival. If the mirror is broken, all trapped victims are instantly freed from its confines.\n\n\nRope of Climbing\nThis magical silk rope measures 50 feet in length. Upon command, it can move at a speed of 10 feet per round in any direction—forward, upward, downward, or otherwise—as desired by its owner. The rope attaches itself securely wherever commanded and can also unfasten and return in the same manner.\nTo support weight other than its own, the rope requires something secure to tie itself to. The user must hold one end of the rope when invoking its magic.\n\n\nModrin’s Glass Cats\nThese legendary wondrous items are tiny glass cat figurines. If the possessor of one is killed, that person’s body disappears in a brilliant flash of light. As the light fades, the body reappears restored to life with all hit points.\nThis effect closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the person when death occurred. It also replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.\nOnce used, the glass cat becomes cracked, tarnished, and non-functional. It cannot be recharged.\n\n\nScarab of Protection\nThis device appears as a silver medallion shaped like a beetle. The scarab absorbs energy-draining attacks, death effects, and curses. After absorbing 2d6 such attacks, it crumbles to dust and is destroyed.\n\n\nSmokestick\nThis alchemically treated wooden stick creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube, dissipating in 1 round if exposed to moderate or stronger wind. The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke naturally dissipates after 1 minute.\n\n\nStone of Commanding Earth Elementals\nA stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped piece of roughly polished rock. By uttering a few words of summoning that require 1 full round to speak, the possessor can summon a Huge earth elemental. Only one elemental can be summoned per day, and it follows the commands of the summoner.\n\n\nStorm in a Bottle\nWithin this elegant glass bottle is a tiny raging thunderstorm. When thrown, it creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air centered on the impact point, lasting 5 rounds. Creatures in the sphere or entering it must succeed on a saving throw vs Breath Weapon or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere creates difficult terrain.\nAdditionally, you can command a bolt of lightning to leap from the sphere’s center toward a creature of your choice within 60 feet, dealing 5d6 lightning damage.\n\n\nThunderstone\nThis stone can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 30 feet. Upon striking a hard surface or being struck hard, it emits a deafening bang treated as a sonic attack. Creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 hour. Deafened creatures suffer a -4 penalty on Initiative and have a 20% chance to miscast any spell with a verbal component.",

    "text": "Albruin\nThis ancient two-handed great sword +2 glows a dim ghostly blue when drawn. It grants +1 to initiative, +1 to Saves vs. Poison, and allows the wielder Darkvision when the blade is drawn.\n\n\nAlayas\nThis elven long sword +1 is overlaid on the hilt with silver and copper. If the wielder scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20, the subsequent d20 roll to determine a special is at an additional +2.\n\n\nAxes of Azaghal\nThese dwarven hand axes +3 allow the wielder to take a penalty of up to -3 to melee attacks in exchange for a bonus of +3 to damage inflicted.\n\n\nBelladonna Scimitar\nThis mirrored silver-bladed scimitar +2 temporarily forces a Lycanthrope from its transformed state for 1d8 rounds on a natural or modified roll of 19 or 20.\n\n\nBlack Sword\nOnly a large-sized (or greater) creature can wield this abysmal great black sword +3. If the wielder scores a hit against a medium or smaller humanoid, the opponent must make a saving throw against Paralysis or Petrify or be knocked prone. A prone opponent has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). Standing back up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.\n\n\nBlazefury, Last Hope of Nyr’s Gate\nThis is a bastard sword +1, +3 against magic users, arcane spell-casting monsters, and arcane summoned creatures.\n\n\nCaladwen\nThis elegant elven dagger +2 can heal 3d6 hit points once per day.\n\n\nCúrandír’s Halberd\nThis elven two-handed polearm has a +3 to hit and damage. If the wielder scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20, the subsequent d20 roll to determine a special is at an additional +2. This weapon may only be wielded by humans and elves (or larger) due to its size.\n\n\nDaggers of Bele and Lokai\nThese matched dwarven daggers are identical except for the stones set into their pommels. One pommel is chalcedony (opaque white), the other is obsidian (opaque black). Both daggers when used together defensively give the user the Parry and Dodge Defensive action with a +4 to AC rather than +2.\nAlternatively, if both daggers are used offensively, the wielder attacks with no penalty to attack with the primary weapon or with the secondary weapon.\nIf both daggers hit the same opponent in a single turn, that creature takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage.\nIf the daggers are used individually, they are just +1 daggers.\n\n\nDancing Edge\nThis elven long sword +1 allows the wielder to take a penalty of -1 to melee attacks in exchange for a bonus of +1 to armor class.\n\n\nDarts of Aiwë (elven for “small bird”)\nThese are 3 magical elven darts +3 that do 1d4 piercing damage at a range up to 100 feet. They have the following additional abilities:\n\nFlight of the Hummingbird: As the darts are thrown, they seem to become alive and fly on their own, ignoring creatures with cover penalty.\nReturning: Instead of an attack, the wielder can make the birds fly back to their empty hand. The darts can be called back from up to 100 feet.\nNectar Harvester: If the attacker rolls a natural 20 (in addition to the subsequent roll to see if it is critical), the attacker is healed the same amount as the opponent is wounded.\n\n\n\nDraug Sváfnir\nThis northern steel long sword +1 has an enchantment that is +3 against demons and allows an extra attack when in combat with demons. It vibrates when within 120 feet of fiends.\n\n\nDrawmij’s Dagger\nDrawmij’s dagger +2 is balanced for throwing and can be instantly summoned into the sapphire ring wearer’s hand as long as the dagger is within 120’ (twice per day) regardless of barriers.\n\n\nFirebrand\nUpon command, this long sword +1, (+2 against trolls, treants, and other creatures especially vulnerable to fire) will be sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until the wielder commands it to stop, or until the weapon is dropped or sheathed.\nWhile it flames, the sword delivers an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. It casts light and burns just as if it were a torch.\n\n\nGiant’s Fist\nThis elven mace +1, if the wielder scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 against a medium or smaller humanoid, the opponent must make a saving throw against Paralysis or Petrify or be knocked prone. A prone opponent has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). Standing back up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.\n\n\nGil-Galad’s Repeating Crossbow\nThis elven crossbow +1 fires 2 bolts (+1 to hit, 1d6 damage) per round. It holds a magazine with 6 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, the user can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 6 bolts is a full-round action.\n\n\nGinnarr\nThis dwarven battle axe +2 endows the wielder with +2 on the Reaction Roll table when dealing with dwarves.\n\n\nGod’s Wrath\nThis elven morning star +1, if the wielder scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20, the character gets an immediate additional attack.\n\n\nKing Maker\nThis elven great axe +1 allows the character once during an encounter to inspire all members within a 20-foot radius to gain a +1 to both their next attack and a +1 to damage.\n\n\nJavelin of Marduk\nThe Javelin of Marduk becomes a bolt of lightning when hurled by a cleric of Marduk. Should this happen, creatures within a five-foot-wide line between the cleric and the target have to make a saving throw vs. wands or suffer 4d6 lightning damage.\n\n\nMace of Disruption\nThis appears to be a mace +1, but it has a good alignment, and any evil character touching it will receive 2d4 points of damage due to the powerful enchantments laid upon the weapon. If a mace of disruption strikes an undead creature it may utterly destroy the creature.\n\n\n\nUndead\nDC + Wis\n\n\n\n\nSkeleton\nDC 10\n\n\nZombie\nDC 12\n\n\nGhoul\nDC 14\n\n\nShadow\nDC 16\n\n\nGhast\nDC 18\n\n\nWight\nDC 20\n\n\nWraith\nDC 21\n\n\nMummy\nDC 22\n\n\nSpectre\nDC 23\n\n\nVampire\nDC 24\n\n\nGhost\nDC 25\n\n\nLich\nDC 26\n\n\n\n\n\nMace of Hecate\nAny one lycanthrope within 30 feet has a chance of being charmed by the wielder of this mace +2. (DC 12)\n\n\nOathbow\nThis beautiful longbow +2 is constructed of flexible, white wood and has ornate, twisting designs carved into its surface. When an arrow is fired, there is a whistling in flight that sounds like a voice whispering in Elven, wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies. The Oathbow has the following additional abilities:\n\nOnce per day, the Oathbow can fire one normal arrow and it becomes six arrows in flight.\nOnce per day, the Oathbow can fire an arrow that acts like a Light Spell.\n\n\n\nRapier of the Rat King\nThis ancient scimitar +3, if the wielder rolls a natural 20 (in addition to the subsequent roll to see if it is critical), the opponent must make a saving throw against Death Ray or Poison. On a fail, a swarm of rats viciously attacks the opponent. The swarm does an additional 1d4 + 6 damage. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible.\nThe rats cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and area effects can force it to disperse by inflicting damage. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 12 hit points from these attacks. A protection from evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately. The swarm is stationary once conjured.\n\n\nReydundoom “Fake Man’s Bane”\nThis dwarven warhammer +1 weighs half as much as a normal warhammer. In addition, whenever it scores a hit against any golem, the golem is stunned for 1d4 rounds.\n\n\nRodwen “Ghost Touch”\nThis long sword +1, +3 against incorporeal or ethereal creatures allows the wielder to sense nearby incorporeal or ethereal creatures in the OnceWas.\n\n\nSerethiel\nThis knife +2 throws like a dagger (1d4) and swings like a short sword (1d6).\n\n\nShield Breaker\nThis elven war hammer +1, if the wielder scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 against a medium or smaller humanoid wearing non-magical armor or bearing a non magical shield, the opponent must make a saving throw against Paralysis or Petrify or their shield or armor is damaged and reduced by 1d4 effectiveness.\n\n\nSyan Lin (Blue Sky)\nThis elven longbow is enchanted +1, +2 against orcs, -4 against elves.\n\n\nVihor, the Dagger of Speed\nThis dagger +2 has an effect identical to Weapon Finesse. A character may use the Dex bonus, rather than Str bonus, when fighting with this dagger in melee combat.\n\n\nWhispering Wind\nThis elven short bow +1 endows the wielder with +2 on the Reaction Roll table when dealing with elves. In addition, the character can fire into melee combat without risk of hitting an ally.\n\n\nVorpal Sword\nThis long sword delivers a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. In addition, the weapon ignores any resistance to slashing damage. It can only be wielded by a magic user and is considered by many to be evil.\nThe Vorpal Sword is solid to the touch and when blocking an opponent’s attack. However, on a successful hit against a living creature, the sword deals damage to the opponent’s soul, passing through armor and clothing. This damage cannot be healed normally or with most healing spells or regeneration. The 6th level Cleric spell Restoration will restore lost hit points.\nIf an opponent reaches 0 hit points, the soul is consumed by the sword. The energy of the soul temporarily grants the wielder increased strength for 1d6 rounds. The Strength bonus varies according to HD.\n\n\n\nHD\nStrength Bonus\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n+1\n\n\n3-5\n+2\n\n\n6-8\n+3\n\n\n9-11\n+4\n\n\n11-20\n+5\n\n\n\nThe Vorpal Sword is a normal long sword when used against the unliving.",

    "text": "Miscellaneous\n\nIggwilv’s Circlet of the Abyss\nThe witch Iggwilv possesses an especially malignant version of a Circlet of the Abyss. Iggwilv’s own circlet is a platinum headpiece adorned with sharp inward-facing barbs that securely hold it in place. It emits an aura of evil and has transformative effects on its wearer. The circlet grants the following properties:\nDemon Shielding: Creates an invisible shield-like force around the wearer, negating magic missile attacks and improving the wearer’s Armor Class by +3.\nEars of Evil: Renders the wearer immune to Command spells.\nEyes of Evil: Grants Darkvision with a range of 60 feet, unaffected by magical darkness, and the ability to perceive outlines of invisible creatures.\nTongue of Evil: Grants the ability to understand and speak Abyssal, and immunity to Silence spells.\nVeil of Evil: Provides immunity to Hold Person, Charm Person, Fear, and Sleep spells.\nQuasit Familiar: Allows the wearer to summon and command a quasit familiar.\nAbysmal Curses:\n\nCorruption: Gradually shifts the wearer towards Chaotic Evil. Surrounding food spoils, plants and animals become sick, and social interactions suffer with a -5 penalty to Reaction Rolls. Holy water inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the wearer starts hearing whispers from demons in their dreams.\nAnimals’ Reaction: Animals initially avoid, then fear, and eventually attack the wearer. They may become unable to ride horses or hunt due to animals fleeing their presence.\nLeeching Joy: Diminishes sensory pleasures—loss of taste, fresh water causing illness, music sounding like noise, and colors appearing less vibrant. Eventually, pleasure comes only from causing or receiving pain and misery.\nLust for Power: Develops an insatiable desire for immense power, either to rule the world or to be the agent of its destruction.\n\n\n\nLamp of Amon\nThis dark hooded lantern glows with a magical blue flame. The lantern sheds bright, bluish light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can reduce the light to a beam or cover it completely.\n500 years ago, the elves of Imladris created the Lamp of Amon. The Elves used it against Malar, the Beastlord, a demonic spirit of bestial savagery and bloodlust, and the source of all lycanthropes. His dogma concerned savage hunts, the spreading of the curse of lycanthropy, and general contempt for civilization.\nThe Elves gravely wounded the demon add it fled to the dark caverns in the Ephel Duath to nurse its wounds.\nLater, Iuz would attack Imladris and steal the lamp. Iuz convinced the Demon to serve him, first by threatening it with the light of the Lamp of Amon, and then by giving the spirit the lamp to destroy.\nAny lycanthropes bathed in the bright light are affected. The Light can drive the evil spirit from the newly cursed. Lycanthropes that have been affected for less than one year are instantly cured.\nIts radiance will consume and destroy the weaker of those too far corrupted. The stronger will be burned and turned away from the light. Lycanthropes affected more than one year with less than 20 hit points are instantly destroyed. Lycanthropes affected more than one year with more than 20 hit points instantly loose 20 hit points.\n\n\nPendant of Eredluin\nThis pendant reflects spells cast directly at the wearer back at the caster, but it does not affect area-effect spells like fireball. It can reflect up to 6 spells before its power is exhausted.\n\n\nPendant of Bruidhinn\nThis pendant has 2d10 charges. When activated, it can perform the following:\nDream (1 charge): The user shapes a creature’s dreams. The target must be on the same plane of existence and asleep. The user enters a trance and can interact with the target’s dreams, shaping the environment and conversing with the sleeping target.\nWhispered Message (2 charges): The user points toward a creature within range and whispers a message. Only the target can hear and reply to the message in a whisper that only the user can hear. The message can pass through solid objects if the target is known and beyond a barrier, but magical silence blocks it.\nGreater Sending (3 charges): The user sends a mental call to a creature they are familiar with. The target hears the call in their mind and can accept or decline it. If accepted, the user and the target can communicate telepathically for up to 1 hour, regardless of distance but not across planes of existence.",

    "text": "City, Town or Village Encounters\nIt’s important for the Dungeon Master to remember that, unlike dungeon or wilderness environments, cities, towns and villages are busy places. During the day, most towns will have people on the streets more or less all the time; the absence of people on the streets is often an indication of something interesting. By night, much of the town will be dark and quiet, and encounters will be mostly Thieves or other unsavory types; but near popular eating (or drinking) establishments, people of all sorts are still likely to be encountered. The DM must make sure that his or her descriptions of the town environment make this clear; of course, this will also make it harder for the players to identify “real” encounters.\nThe DM is encouraged to create his or her own encounter tables for use in each city, town or village created (or assign encounters by other means if desired); however, a set of “generic” encounter tables are provided below for those times when such preparation has not been completed. Roll 2d6 on the table below to determine what sort of encounter occurs; a description of each type of encounter appears below the table.\n\nInputs.button(html`&lt;button style=\"color: black; background-color: lightgray;\"&gt;Roll on Table&lt;/button&gt;`, \n{value: 0, \nreduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#city-encounters\", \ngeneralTableSelect([2,6,0],[[ 2 , 2 ],[ 3 , 3 ],[ 4 , 4 ],[ 5 , 5 ],[ 6 , 6 ],[ 7 , 7 ],[ 8 , 8 ],[ 9 , 9 ],[ 10, 10],[ 11, 11],[ 12, 12]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2d6)\nDay Encounter\nNight Encounter\n\n\n\n\n2\nDoppleganger\nDoppleganger\n\n\n3\nNoble\nShadow*\n\n\n4\nThief\nPress Gang\n\n\n5\nBully\nBeggar\n\n\n6\nCity Watch\nThief\n\n\n7\nMerchant\nBully\n\n\n8\nBeggar\nMerchant\n\n\n9\nPriest\nGiant Rat\n\n\n10\nMercenary\nCity Watch\n\n\n11\nWizard\nWizard\n\n\n12\nLycanthrope, Wererat*\nLycanthrope, Wererat*\n\n\n\n\nBeggar encounters will often begin with a single beggar approaching the party, but there will generally be 2d4 beggars in the area, and if any party member gives anything to the first beggar, the others will descend on the party like flies. Each beggar is 90% likely to be a normal man, and 10% likely to be a 1st level Thief, possibly scouting for the Thieves Guild or a local gang.\nBully encounters will be with 2d4 young toughs; each is 70% likely to be a normal man, 30% likely to be a 1st level Fighter. Bullies generally appear unarmed, depending on their brawling ability in a fight (but keeping a dagger or shortsword hidden, to be used in case the fight is going against them). Bullies can be a bit unpredictable, such that the DM may want to use a reaction roll to determine the leader’s mood.\nCity Watch encounters will be with 2d6 watchmen, all 1st level Fighters save for the squad leader, who will be from 2nd through 4th level. They will confront “suspicious-looking” characters, but generally will need a good reason before they attempt to arrest or otherwise interfere with player characters.\nDoppleganger encounters will, of course, appear to be some other type of encounter; the DM should roll again to determine what the doppleganger is masquerading as. 1d6 dopplegangers will be encountered; any extra group members will be humans who do not know they are traveling in the company of shapeshifting monsters. If the party is “interesting” to the dopplegangers, one or more of the monsters will attempt to follow them and replace a party member (as described in the monster description). In many cases, player character parties will not discover the true nature of the encounter until much later.\nGiant Rat encounters will generally involve alleys, the docks, or other “low” places. Rats are generally not dangerous unless provoked, but if surprised they may attack. See the monster description for details of this encounter type.\nLycanthrope, Wererat encounters will appear to be some other type of encounter, either another sort of “normal” encounter or a giant rat encounter (depending on the circumstances). Wererats are cowardly and will not attack a party of equal or larger size.\nMercenary encounters will involve 2d6 members of a mercenary company, going about some business or other. A mercenary leader may offer a position to Fighter-classed player characters if they have any reputation at all.\nMerchants are a common feature of towns, and may be encountered performing any sort of business. As with mercenary encounters, merchants may offer jobs to interesting player characters, particularly those with good reputations. See Creating an NPC Party, below, for details on this type of encounter. (A merchant in a town may not have a full entourage as described below; the DM should use his or her discretion in creating the encounter.)\nNobles encountered may also offer positions to player characters, or possibly offer a reward for some dangerous task. Player characters with bad reputations may be confronted, ordered to leave town, or even arrested if the noble is able to call for the city watch. (See Creating an NPC Party, below, for details on this type of encounter.) A noble in a town may not have a full entourage as described below; the DM should use his or her discretion in creating the encounter.\nPress Gangs will consist of 2d6 Fighters, all 1st level except for one or two leaders of 2nd through 5th level. They will be armed with blunt weapons or possibly will fight with their bare hands, since their goal is to capture rather than kill player characters; however, it is likely that at least some members of a press gang will have daggers or swords on their persons in case a serious fight breaks out. A press gang will not confront a party of equal or greater size unless the party is obviously weakened, drunk, etc. If the party loses, they will awaken aboard a ship at sea or in a military camp (depending on whether sailors or soldiers captured them), unarmed and at the mercy of their captors.\nPriest encounters will usually be similar to a group of pilgrims (see Creating an NPC Party, below, for details), though the group encountered will not be as large as would be encountered in the wilderness. Generally, a single priest of 1st through 4th level will be encountered, accompanied by 1d4 of the faithful.\nShadow encounters in a town will be much like the same encounter underground; see the monster description for details.\nThief encounters will be with a group of 1d6 Thieves, generally disguised as ordinary townsmen or sometimes as beggars. One Thief in the group will be from 2nd to 4th level, with the others being 1st level only. They will seek to steal from the party, of course, unless watched very carefully.\nWizard encounters will involve a Magic-User of 4th through 7th level, accompanied by 1d4-1 apprentices of 1st level. The DM must decide on the temperament and mood of the wizard.",

    "section": "Creating An NPC Party",
    "text": "Creating An NPC Party\n\nAdventurers\nA party of NPC adventurers will usually consist of 4-8 characters, as follows: 1d3 Fighters, 1d2 Thieves, 1d2 Clerics, and 1d2-1 Magic-Users. Usually the characters will all be of similar levels; after deciding what average level the party should be, you may wish to make a few of the characters lower levels (to reflect the usual “replacements” brought in when some characters die).\nThe Dungeon Master must choose the race(s) of the NPC adventurers to suit the region they are found in (or come from). Probably 80% or more of adventurers are Human, 10% are Dwarves, 6% are Halfling and the remaining 4% Elvish. If the NPC adventurer party is evil, the DM may choose to replace some party members with humanoid monsters such as orcs, hobgoblins, or gnolls.\nThe party may be rivals with the player characters, vying for the same treasures, or they may actually be enemies, evil marauders that the player characters must defeat. It is, of course, possible that the NPC adventurers are allied or otherwise friendly with the player characters, but this may make things too easy for the players.\n\n\nBandits, Brigands, and Highwaymen\nA party of bandits will generally consist of 2d12 1st level Fighters and 1d6 1st level Thieves, led by a Fighter or Thief of 2nd to 5th level (1d4+1) or by one of each class (if there are 11 or more 1st level members total). In the wilderness, bandits will generally have horses or other steeds appropriate to the terrain (stolen, of course) as well as light armor, swords and bows or crossbows. Determine magic items as given below for the leaders only; rank-and-file members will not normally have magic items.\nIn their lair or hideout, a party of bandits will generally have type A treasure (with magic items omitted since they will have already been generated using the rules below).\n\n\nBuccaneers and Pirates\nThe difference between buccaneers and pirates is largely a question of what they wish to be called; whatever you call them, they are waterborne equivalents of bandits, attacking other ships or raiding coastal towns for plunder.\nA buccaneer party will consist of 3d8 1st level Fighters, led by a Fighter of 3rd to 6th level (1d4+2) and 1d3 Fighters of 2nd to 5th level. All will be experienced at handling ships, of course. They will be unarmored or armored only in leather, and will be armed with swords and bows or crossbows.\nSeagoing pirates may appear in larger numbers, but the number of leader-types will be similar to that given above. Generate magic items for leaders only as described below. A shipload of pirates or buccaneers will have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted (since magic items will already have been rolled for the NPCs); the treasure may not be aboard the ship, however, as pirates often prefer to bury their treasures on islands. In such a case, the Captain or one of his mates will have a treasure map leading to the location of the treasure.\n\n\nMerchants\nMerchants must often transport their wares through wilderness areas. Roughly half of the time (50%), a land-bound merchant party will be led by a single wealthy merchant; other merchant parties will consist of 1d4+1 less wealthy merchants who have banded together for their own safety. There will be 2d4 wagons (but at least one per merchant) drawn by horses or mules. Each wagon is driven by a teamster who is a normal man, usually unarmored and armed with a dagger or shortsword. The caravan will employ 1d4+2 first-level Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters as guards.\nIf encountered at sea, a merchant party will generally consist of a single ship owned or rented by a single merchant. The ship will have a crew of 2d8+8 regular crewmen, who are normal men, unarmored and armed with clubs, daggers or shortswords; the Captain, First Mate, and other officers are taken from this number. Large ships may require larger crews. 1d4+2 first-level Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters will be aboard as guards, just as with a caravan.\nBesides the valuable but undoubtedly bulky trade goods transported by the merchant caravan or ship, such a party will also have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted; it may be in one chest, or spread out among the wagons.\n\n\nNobles\nA noble party will consist of a noble (of course), possibly accompanied by a spouse (also a noble, of course) and/or one or more children. Each adult noble will have at least one attendant (assistant, lady-in-waiting, etc.).\nLower-ranking nobles (such as barons) will have a single wagon or carriage, drawn by fine horses; higher-ranking nobles will have two or more wagons. The noble may be mounted on a warhorse, though he or she may choose to ride in a carriage part of the time. Each carriage or wagon will have a teamster, who in this case will be a 1st level Fighter in chainmail with a longsword. At least two mounted Fighters of 1st through 4th level will be with the noble as guards; again, higher ranking nobles will have more guards. Guards will generally be armed with longswords and possibly lances, armored in platemail, and their warhorses will usually be barded with chainmail. Determining the exact number of guards is left to the DM in this case. The normal chances for magic items apply, of course.\nA noble will usually be traveling with a little spending money; a type A treasure should be rolled to represent this. In this case, do not omit the magic items, as nobles will generally be more wealthy than the average party of men.\nNobles are usually (70%) normal men; otherwise, roll 1d10: 1-6 indicates a Fighter, 7-8 indicates a Magic-User, 9 indicates a Cleric, and 10 indicates a Thief. (Clerical “nobles” are bishops, archbishops, and the like.) Roll 2d4-1 for the level of each “classed” noble.\n\n\nPilgrims\nA party of pilgrims is on its way to (or from) a major religious locale or activity. Such a party will be led by a 1d4 Clerics of level 1-4 (roll for each).\nThe remainder of the party is rather random in nature; most pilgrim groups include 3d6 normal men (or women if the religion allows women to go on pilgrimages), 1d6 Fighters of level 1-4 (roll for each) with chainmail and longsword, and 1d4 Thieves of level 1-4 (each of whom may be a genuine devout person, or possibly just on the lam). There is also a 50% chance of a single Magic-User of level 1-4 being with the party.\nPilgrims usually travel light, carrying a single bag each and walking or riding mules or horses. The pilgrim party will most likely be bringing offerings of some sort to their destination; generate a type A treasure for this purpose. If magic items are indicated, they will most likely not be used by any of the NPCs as they have already been dedicated to the god or pantheon.\n\n\nMagic Items for NPCs\nNPCs will generally have magic items in proportion to their class and level; assume a 5% chance per level that any given Fighter, Thief or Cleric NPC will have a magic weapon or magic armor (roll for weapon and armor separately for each NPC). Regardless of level, a roll of 96-00 should be considered a failure. Magic-Users will have a Ring of Protection (roll the bonus as usual for the item) on a roll of 4% per level, and a magic dagger or walking staff on a roll of 3% per level.\nIn addition, assume a 2% per level chance that any given character will have a potion, and 3% per level that a Cleric or Magic-User will have a scroll of some sort.\nFinally, add up the levels of all members of the party, and use this number as a percentage chance that a Miscellaneous Magic item will be found among them. If the roll is made, divide the number by two and roll again; if the second roll is made, two such items are found. If the party has more than 3 members, you might wish to divide the number in half again and roll for a third such item. Assign the Miscellaneous Magic item or items to whichever party members seem most appropriate, or roll randomly if you can’t decide.\n\n\nDemi-Human Parties\nIt is assumed above that NPC parties will be Human, or predominantly so; but the Dungeon Master may choose to present parties of Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings from time to time. In general, a party of demi-humans will be homogeneous…. an Elf party would consist of all Elves, for instance. If encountered in the territory of another race, the demi-human party might include a guide hired to lead them to their destination. For example, the Elf party mentioned above might hire a Human guide to help them when traveling through a Human country.\nThe Dungeon Master may simply use the figures given above when generating such parties. One thing that the DM must decide is whether or not the “normal men” rules apply to demi-humans… are there “normal elves” for instance? This decision is left to the DM. If there are such characters, they will have the same racial abilities as others of their race, but will fight with an Attack Bonus of +0 just as normal men do. If there are no such characters in the campaign world, then simply substitute 1st level Fighters for the normal men listed above.",

    "section": "Dealing with Players",
    "text": "Dealing with Players\n\nCharacter Creation Options\nThe standard character creation rules call for rolling 3d6 for each Ability Score in order. Players may complain that they can’t create the sort of characters they want to play. Here are several options you may choose from if you wish to make things easier for your players. Note that the players must not be allowed to demand these options; it’s purely the decision of the Dungeon Master .\nPoint Swapping: Allow the player to “move” points from one Ability Score to another, at a rate of -2 to one score for each +1 added to the other. The maximum score is still 18 (or the racial maximum if lower), and the player should not be allowed to lower any score below 9.\nScore Swapping: Let the player exchange any two Ability Scores, once per character.\nThe Full Shuffle: Let the player arrange the six Ability Score values as he or she wishes. This allows the most customization for the player, but on the other hand you may find that all player characters in your campaign begin to look very much alike. It’s not uncommon for players to “dump” the lowest statistic in Charisma, for instance.\n\n\nHopeless Characters\nSometimes a player will roll for ability scores, look at the ability scores rolled, and declare the character “hopeless.” Of course, no player can be required to play a character with less than 9 in the first four scores, since all four classes would be unavailable to that character. However, you as the Dungeon Master might choose to allow the player to reroll a character with scores that are overall below average even if the character isn’t as “hopeless” as this.\nHere’s an alternate suggestion: Allow the player to “flip” all of their scores by subtracting them from 21. This will turn a roll of 15 (+1 bonus) into a 6 (-1 penalty) but turn a roll of 3 (-3 penalty) into an 18 (+3 bonus). This will result in a character who previously had mostly penalties becoming one with mostly bonuses. If this is allowed, all scores must be flipped, not just the bad ones! Doing this ensures the character is playable while still allowing the possibility of some penalty scores.\nIt is of course possible to roll all average scores, such that the character has neither bonuses nor penalties and would not gain any benefit from flipping scores. The choice here should be the player’s; if they wish to reroll all scores, the DM should probably allow it.\n\n\nAcquisition of Spells\nClerics have an obvious advantage over Magic-Users, in that, in theory, they have access to any spell of any level which they can cast. However, note that Clerics are limited in their spell selection based on their deity, faith or ethos; for instance, a Cleric of the goddess of healing should not be surprised that their deity refuses to grant reversed healing spells. If a Cleric prays for a spell that is not allowed, the Dungeon Master may choose to grant the character a different spell, or optionally (if the deity is angered) no spell at all for that “slot.”\nMagic-Users begin play knowing two spells, read magic plus one other (unless the DM grants more starting spells). Each time the character gains a level, they gain the ability to cast more spells; in addition, every other level the Magic-User gains access to the next higher level spells (until all levels are available). However, gaining the ability to cast these spells does not necessarily mean the Magic-User instantly learns new spells.\nMagic-Users may learn spells by being taught by another Magic-User, or by studying another Magic- User’s spellbook. If being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day; researching another Magic-User’s spellbook takes one day per spell level. In either case, the spell learned must be transcribed into the Magic- User’s own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per spell level transcribed.\nA Magic-User may add a new spell of any level they may cast at any point; however, spells of higher levels may not be learned or added to the Magic-User’s spellbook. The Magic-User must find a teacher or acquire a reference work (such as another Magic-User’s spellbook) in order to learn new spells, and the cost of such is in addition to the costs given above. Often a Magic-User will maintain a relationship with their original master, who will teach the character new spells either for free or in return for services. Sometimes two Magic-Users will agree to exchange known spells. In many cases the only option available to a Magic-User will be to pay another Magic-User (often an NPC) anywhere from 100 gp to 1000 gp per spell level in return for such training.\nMagic-Users may also create entirely new spells (or alter existing spells); see the Magic Research rules, below, for details.\n\n\nWeapon and Armor Restrictions\nSeveral races and classes have weapon and/or armor restrictions applied to them. What happens when a player declares that his or her character is going to use a prohibited weapon or wear prohibited armor?\nClerics: The prohibition against edged weapons is a matter of faith for Clerics. Therefore, if a Cleric uses a prohibited weapon, he or she immediately loses access to his or her spells as well as the power to Turn the Undead. A higher-level NPC Cleric of the same faith must assign some quest to the miscreant which must be completed in order for the fallen Cleric to atone and regain his or her powers. If unrepentant, the character is changed permanently from a Cleric to a Fighter. Refigure the character’s level, applying the current XP total to the Fighter table to determine this. Hit points and attack bonus remain the same; change the attack bonus only after a new level is gained as a Fighter, and roll Fighter hit dice as normal when levels are gained.\nMagic-Users: These characters are simply untrained in any weapon other than those normally allowed to them, and should suffer a -5 attack penalty when using any prohibited weapon. A Magic-User in armor can’t cast spells at all; any such attempt fails, and the spell is lost.\nThieves: Wearing armor heavier, more restrictive and/or noisier than leather armor prevents the use of any Thief ability, including the Sneak Attack ability. Thieves may choose to wear such armor, but this only makes them a poor excuse for a Fighter.\nDwarves and Halflings: These characters are prohibited from using large weapons, mainly due to their small stature and relatively low weight. It’s hard to swing a weapon when the weapon is trying to swing you. If such a character tries to use a prohibited weapon, the Dungeon Master may either apply a -5 attack penalty based on the difficulty of using the weapon, or alternately declare the attempt unsuccessful, at his or her option.\n\n\nJudging Wishes\nWishes are one of the most potentially unbalancing things in the game. With a carefully worded wish, a player character can make sweeping, dramatic changes in the game world, possibly even rewriting history. Before allowing the player characters in your game access to even one wish, think about how you will deal with it.\nWishes are granted by a variety of beings. Even when a wish comes from a device (a ring or a sword, for instance), some extradimensional being, god or devil or whatever, has placed that wish in the device. A wish will tend to further the goals of the granting being; if the granter is an evil efreeti, for instance, it will attempt to twist the meaning or intent of the wish so that it does not really accomplish what the player character wants. On the other hand, if the granter is one of the good powers, it will grant the wish as intended so long at the player character isn’t being greedy or spiteful.\nGame balance is the main issue that must be considered. Using a wish to heal the entire party, teleport everyone without error to a distant location, or to avoid or redo a catastrophic battle, is reasonable. A wish that a character be restored to life and health is reasonable, but a wish that not only restores but also improves the character is not.\nIn general, a wish is granted with at least literal accuracy… the words of the wish must be fulfilled. The exception is wishes that are unreasonable for game balance purposes; they are still at least literally interpreted, but may be only partially granted. In the last example above, for instance, the granting power would likely restore the character to life and health but ignore the “improvements” wished for.",

    "title": "29  Managing Encounters",
    "section": "Optional Rules",
    "text": "Optional Rules\n\nDeath and Dying\nThe rules state that, at zero hit points, the character is dead. If this is too harsh for you, here are several approaches to changing the situation:\nRaise Dead: The first approach doesn’t change the rules a bit. Arrange matters so that characters killed in an adventure can be easily raised (but at a substantial cost). This not only “deals” with the mortality issue, it also soaks up excess treasure, preventing the player characters from becoming too rich to be interested in adventuring. It also tends to reward the cautious (since they get to keep their gold more often).\nWhat if the characters don’t have enough money when they die to afford to be raised? Allow the local religious establishment to raise dead adventurers in return for their indenture… that is, the adventurers, upon being restored to life, owe the church or temple the money it would have cost to be raised, or an equivalent service. Thus, the local religious leaders would have a ready pool of adventurers to undertake dangerous missions for them.\nBut the adventurer(s) are dead… how can they agree to the indenture? There are two options: the priests can use speak with dead to attain agreement, or the adventurers can sign an agreement with the church before leaving on the potentially dangerous adventure. The latter might even be considered a standard procedure in some places.\nSave vs. Death: The first actual rule alteration is to allow characters reduced to zero hit points to save vs. Death Ray to avoid death. If the save is failed, the character is immediately dead, just as in the normal rules. If the save is made, the character remains alive for 2d10 rounds; if the character’s wounds are bound (or he or she receives healing magic) within this time frame, death is averted. The character remains unconscious for the full 2d10 rounds rolled, either dying if left untreated or awakening if his or her wounds are bound.\nBinding the wounds of the dying character stabilizes him or her at zero hit points. Non-magical healing will require a full week to restore the first hit point; after this, healing proceeds at the normal rate.\nMagical healing will restore the character to whatever total is rolled on the healing die roll (up to the usual maximum of course).\nNote that any spellcaster reduced to zero hit points who subsequently survives loses all remaining prepared spells.\nThis rule might be combined with the suggestions under Raise Dead, above.\nNegative Hit Points: Instead of stopping at zero hit points, keep track of the current negative figure. At the end of each round after he or she falls, the character loses an additional hit point. If a total of -10 is reached, the character is dead. Before this point is reached, the character may have his or her wounds bound and/or receive magical healing, which will stabilize the character. The injured character may not move more than a few feet without help, nor fight, nor cast spells, until his or her hit points are again greater than zero. This rule should not be combined with the Save vs. Death option.\nJust as with the Save vs. Death rule, spellcasters who survive being reduced to zero or negative hit points lose all currently prepared spells.\nAs a further option, the DM may choose to use a negative number equal to the character’s Constitution score rather than a straight -10.\n\n\n“Save or Die” Poison\nPoisons, as described in the Encounter and Monster sections, kill characters instantly. Game Masters may find this makes the mortality rate of player characters a bit too high. On the other hand, poisons should be scary. Here’s an optional rule which may make things a bit easier without entirely removing the fear from poison:\nWhere a “save or die” poison is indicated, the victim must make a save vs. Poison or suffer 1d6 damage per round for 6 rounds, starting the round following the exposure to the poison; this is an average of 21 points of damage, but even a first level character might survive with a combination of luck and healing magic. The DM may create poisons which vary from these figures, of course. If the Negative Hit Points optional rule is being used, it is suggested to increase the poison duration to 10 rounds (an average 35 points).\n\n\nAwarding Experience Points for Treasure Gained\nThe Dungeon Master may also assign experience points for treasure gained, at a rate of 1 GP = 1 XP. This is optional; GMs wishing to advance their players to higher levels more quickly may choose to do this, while those preferring a more leisurely pace should omit it. If experience is awarded for treasure, it should be awarded only for treasure acquired and returned to a place of safety. Alternately, the DM may require treasure to be spent on training in order to count it for experience. This is a highly effective way to remove excess treasure from the campaign.\n\n\nAbility Rolls\nThere will be times when a player character tries to do something in the game that seems to have no rule covering it. In some of those cases, the only attribute the PC has that seems appropriate may be an Ability Score. Here is a suggested method for making rolls against Ability Scores that still gives better odds to higher level characters:\nThe player rolls 1d20 and adds his or her Ability Bonus for the score the DM thinks is most appropriate, as well as any situational bonus or penalty the DM assigns. Consult the following table. If the total rolled is equal to or higher than the given Target number, the roll is a success.\n\n\n\nLevel\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nNM or 1\n17\n\n\n2-3\n16\n\n\n4-5\n15\n\n\n6-7\n14\n\n\n8-9\n13\n\n\n10-11\n12\n\n\n12-13\n11\n\n\n14-15\n10\n\n\n16-17\n9\n\n\n18-19\n8\n\n\n20\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing Spells from Memory\nSometimes a Magic-User will want to prepare spells, but his or her spellbook may be unavailable; this includes when the book has been destroyed or stolen as well as times when the Magic-User has been captured or trapped.\nA Magic-User can always prepare read magic from memory. Other spells require an Intelligence ability roll, as described above, with the spell level as a penalty on the die roll.\nFailure exhausts the spell slot being prepared, just as if it had been successfully prepared and then cast; so if a 5th level Magic-User attempts to prepare fireball from memory, and fails, he or she will have no 3rd level spells for the day.\n\n\nThief Abilities\nSome players of Thieves may wish to have more control over their Thief abilities. If you study the Thief Abilities table, you’ll discover its secret: from levels 2-9, the Thief improves 30 percentiles (total) each level; from levels 10-15, 20 percentiles; and from level 16 on, 10 percentiles. If you wish to allow Thief customization, simply let the player allocate these points as he or she wishes rather than following the table. Allow no more than 10 percentiles to be added to any single Thief ability per level gain. Note also that no Thief ability may be raised above 99 percent.",

    "text": "Magical Research\n\nGeneral Rules for Research\nAt some point a Magic-User or Cleric may wish to start creating magic items or inventing spells. This is termed magical research. For any research, Magic-User must have a tower or laboratory, while a Cleric requires a properly consecrated temple or church of his or her faith. In addition, there will be a cost for the creation of each item, a minimum time required to create it, and a given chance of success. If the roll fails, generally the time and money are wasted and the procedure must be started again from the beginning; however, consult the detailed rules below for exceptions.\nIn almost all cases, the Dungeon Master should make this roll in secret. There are many situations where the character (or the player) should not know whether the roll has actually failed, or whether the DM has decided the research is impossible for the character. The DM may decide to tell the player that the research is impossible if the roll succeeds; if the roll is a failure, that is all the player should be told.\nIn general, Clerics may only create magic items reproducing the effects of Clerical spells; Clerics may also make enchanted weapons and armor, even those sorts which they may not use themselves (since they may be creating weapons or armor for other followers of their faith). Magic-Users may create any sort of magic item except for those reproducing Clerical spells for which no equivalent Magic-User spell exists.\nTime spent doing magical research must be eight-hour workdays with interruptions lasting no more than two days. Longer interruptions result in automatic failure of the project.\nThe DM may, if he or she so desires, grant Experience Points to characters who successfully complete magical research. It is suggested that the rate of such awards be 1 XP per 10 gp spent on the research. This award may be granted for all research, or only for creation of magic items, or not at all if the DM prefers to emphasize adventuring for advancement purposes.\n\n\nSpell Research\nResearching new spells is the most common type of magical research. A Magic-User may research a standard spell, removing the need for a teacher or reference; alternately, a Cleric or Magic-User may research an entirely new spell. Of course, no character may invent or research a spell of a level higher than he or she can cast.\nIf the character is inventing a spell outright, the DM must determine the spell’s level and judge whether or not the spell is possible “as is.” The DM does not have to tell the player whether the spell is possible, and in fact this may be preferable.\nThe cost to research a spell is 1,000 gp per spell level for “standard” spells, or 2,000 gp per spell level for newly invented spells; in either case, one week is required per spell level to complete the research. The chance of success is 25%, plus 5% per level of the character, minus 10% per level of the spell; the maximum chance of success is 95%.\nIf the research roll is successful, the character may add the spell to his or her spellbook (if a Magic-User) or may subsequently pray for the spell (if a Cleric). On a failure, the money and time are spent to no avail. Clerics of the same deity, faith or ethos may teach each other the prayers required to access new spells; this takes one hour per spell level. The procedure to exchange spells with other Magic-Users has already been explained (under Acquisition of Spells, above).\nAs mentioned above, the DM may decide that a proposed new spell is not “correct” for his or her campaign; too powerful, too low in level, etc. Rather than tell the player this, there are two strategies that may be used.\nFirst, the Dungeon Master may decide to revise the spell. If the roll is a success, the DM then presents the player with a revised writeup of the spell, adjusted however the DM feels necessary for game balance purposes.\nThe alternative, more appropriate when the DM believes the spell should be higher level than the player character can cast, is to make the roll anyway. If the roll fails, that is all the player needs to know; but if it succeeds, the DM should then show the player the revised version of the spell and explain that the character may try again when he or she attains a high enough level to cast it. In this case, the DM may allow the character to reduce either the time or the cost by half when the research is attempted again at the higher level.\n\n\nMagic Item Research\nAny character who wishes to create magical items must know all (if any) spells to be imbued in the item. Items that produce effects not matching any known spell may require additional research (to devise the unknown spell) if the DM so desires.\nSome magic items require one or more special components that cannot usually be bought. Special components can only be used once on such a project. For example, the DM might require the skin of a displacer to create a cloak of displacement, or red dragon saliva to create a wand of fireballs. Note that there are specific rules for components under Other Magic Items, below.\nSpecial component requirements are entirely at the option of the Dungeon Master , and are usually employed to slow the creation of powerful magic items that might tend to unbalance the campaign. It’s also a good way to lead the spellcaster (and his party) into dangerous adventures.\n\n\nChance of Success\nUnless given differently below, the base chance of success creating a magic item is 15% plus 5% per level of the spellcaster, plus the spellcaster’s full Intelligence (if a Magic-User) or Wisdom (if a Cleric). Thus, a 9th level spellcaster with a 15 Prime Requisite has a base chance of 75%.\n\n\nSpell Scrolls\nA spellcaster may create a scroll containing any spell he or she has access to (for a Magic-User, spells in his or her spellbook; for a Cleric, any spell the character might successfully pray for). The cost is 500 gp per spell level, and the time required is 1 day per spell level.\nReduce the chance of success based on the level of the spell being inscribed, at a rate of -10% per level.\nIf the roll fails, the enchantment of the scroll has failed; however, if the caster tries again to inscribe the same spell, either the cost or the time is reduced by half (at the character’s option).\n\n\nOther Single-Use Items\nScrolls (other than spell scrolls), potions, and a few other items (such as the rod of cancellation) are single-use items. These items may be created by Magic-Users or Clerics of the 7th level or higher.\nThe chance of success is as given for scrolls, above, when the item being created reproduces a known spell (or when the DM decides a spell must be created, as described above). For other types of items, the DM should assign a spell level as he or she sees fit, and the cost and time required is doubled (making up for the spell research or knowledge required for spell-reproducing items). The time required is one week plus one day per spell level (or equivalent), and the cost to enchant the item is 50 gp per spell level, per day.\nPotions are a special case; the character creating a potion may create a large batch, consisting of several doses, which may be bottled in separate vials or combined in a larger flask. For each additional dose created at the same time, reduce the chance of success by 5% and increase the time required by one day. Note that increasing the time required will directly increase the cost. If the roll to create the item fails, the entire batch is spoiled.\n\n\nPermanent Magic Items\nCreating permanent magic items (rings, weapons, wands, staves, and most miscellaneous magic items) requires a Magic-User or Cleric of the 9th level or higher.\nWhen enchanting an item with multiple abilities, each ability of the item requires a separate roll for success; the first failed roll ends the enchantment process. Such an item will still perform the powers or effects already successfully enchanted into it, but no further enchantment is possible.\nPermanent magic items, including weapons (described in detail below), must be created from high-quality items. The cost of such items will generally be ten times the normal cost for such an item.\n\n\nEnchanting Weapons\nThe base cost of enchanting a weapon or armor is 1,000 gp per point of bonus. For weapons with two bonuses, divide the larger bonus in half (don’t round) and add the smaller bonus; thus, a sword +1, +3 vs. dragons would cost 2,500 gp to enchant. Enchanting a weapon takes one week plus two days per point of bonus; thus, the sword described would require twelve days to enchant.\nReduce the chance of success by 10% times the bonus; so, a sword +1 would reduce the base chance 10%, while the sword +1, +3 vs. dragons described above would reduce the base chance 25%. Further, the chance of success may be increased 25% by doubling the cost and time required (this decision must be announced before the roll is made).\nFor weapons having additional powers, combine the rules above with the rules for creating permanent items. All enchantments must be applied in a single enchantment “session.”\n\n\nOther Magic Items\nMagic items can have several features. Each feature added to a magic item increases the cost and the time required, and decreases the chance of success. The features are as follows:\nCreates a spell or spell-like effect: This is the basic feature of all non-weapon magic items. The base cost of this enchantment is 500 gp per spell level; time required is five days plus two days per level. If the magic item has multiple spell or spell-like effects, add the cost and time figures together. The chance of success is reduced 5% per spell level.\nHas multiple charges: This includes, of course, wands and staffs, but several other magic items would also have charges. Each spell or spell-like effect normally has a separate pool of charges (but see next). The table below shows the various maximum charge levels and the associated cost, time and chance adjustments:\n\n\n\nCharge Level\nCost per Charge\nCharges per Day\nChance\n\n\n\n\n2-3\n+150 gp\n1\n- 5%\n\n\n4-7\n+125 gp\n2\n- 10%\n\n\n8-20\n+100 gp\n3\n- 20%\n\n\n21-30\n+75 gp\n4\n- 30%\n\n\n\nWhen using the table above, don’t count the first charge for cost or time purposes. Note that each separate pool of charges in the item must be figured separately.\nItem can be recharged: Figure the additional cost and time, and the penalty to the chance of success, for rechargeable items as being exactly twice the figures from the table above; so, creating a rechargeable item with 3 charges costs 600 gp more rather than 300 gp more, and takes two days per charge (or four extra days); the chance of success is lowered 10% rather than 5%.\nItem recharges itself: Creating a self-recharging item is expensive; apply the following adjustments to the charge cost, time and chance for items that recharge automatically. Note that self-recharging items are never “rechargeable” in that they may not be recharged other than by themselves.\n\n\n\nCharging Rate\nCost\nTime\nChance\n\n\n\n\n1 per day\nx 3\nx 2\n- 10%\n\n\nAll per day\nx 5\nx 3\n- 30%\n\n\nAll per week\nx 4\nx 2\n- 20%\n\n\n\nCharges are generic: This means that all the effects of the item draw power from the same pool of charges; most Magic-User staffs are in this category. Items with generic charges are automatically rechargeable; don’t apply the normal adjustments for this feature. Instead, combine the normal costs for the charge pools of each effect (which must all have the same number of charges), and then divide the charge cost, time and chance adjustments by two. Thus, two effects sharing one pool costs the same as a single effect with a single pool.\nItem may be used by any class: By default, magic items may only be used by the class that created them; so a wand of fireballs is normally usable only by Magic-Users, or a staff of healing only by Clerics. This feature allows the item to be used by any class of character, and involves assigning simple command words and gestures to the item. Adding this feature costs 1,000 gp per effect. Note that all the item’s effects do not have to be covered; it is possible to create an item where some effects may be used by any class, but other effects may only be used by the creator’s class.\nItem operates continuously or automatically: This feature supersedes both the charges and item use features. The item works whenever properly worn, or activates automatically when required. A ring of fire resistance is a good example; also, the ring of invisibility is in this category. Adding this feature multiplies the final cost and time figures by five and applies a 40% penalty to the chance of success.\nEach feature above applied to a magic item will require a valuable, rare and/or magical material to support the enchantment. For example, a wand of fireballs has a spell effect that is powered by charges; these are two relatively ordinary features, so the Magic-User creating the item proposes a rare wood for the shaft and a 1,000 gp value ruby for the tip. The DM may, of course, require something more rare or valuable if the magic item is particularly powerful.\nThe base cost of a spell effect feature can be reduced by 25% by applying limits to the ability. For example, a ring of charm dryad is an example of limited charm person spell effect, which would qualify for the deduction. This does not affect the chance of success or the time required.\nWeapons which are to be enchanted with additional powers other than the normal bonus require combining the standard weapon enchantment rules with the rules given above. Perform the weapon enchantment first; if it is successful, then the character enchanting the weapon must immediately (within two days, as previously explained) begin the spell or spell-like power enchantment process. Failure of the second procedure does not spoil the weapon enchantment.\n\n\nCursed Items\nSome cursed items, such as cursed scrolls, are created that way specifically by the spellcaster. The difficulty of creating such an item is roughly the same as the difficulty of creating a spell scroll of bestow curse.\nOther cursed magic items may be the result of a failed attempt to create a useful item. The DM must decide whether or not a failed research project will actually create a cursed item.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1. Think About Why\nWhen creating a dungeon, the first question you must answer is: Why will your player characters risk going into this dangerous dungeon full of monsters and traps?\nHere are some possible scenarios:\nTo Explore the Unknown: This is common in pulp fiction. One or more of the player characters has heard of some ancient site, and wishes to explore purely for knowledge. Possibly some of the other player characters are involved for other reasons.\nTo Battle An Evil Incursion: Goblins are raiding farms in the area, and the Baron has offered a reward for stopping the raids; the player characters are happy to help.\nTo Rescue A Kidnapped Victim: Some friend of the player characters has been kidnapped, and they must sneak into or storm the villain’s tower/cave/dungeon to rescue the victim. Or, perhaps, the victim is the son or daughter of the local Baron or a wealthy merchant who offers a reward for the safe return of his or her offspring.\nTo Fulfill A Quest: The local church, to whom the player characters owe a favor, would like an ancient relic recovered from a lost mountain fortress, and the High Priest asks them to look into it; or some similar task might be assigned, depending on who the player characters owe a favor.\nTo Get Loot: This is a surprisingly common scenario (well, perhaps not so surprising). The dungeon is rumored to contain a hidden treasure of great value, and the first characters to find it will be rich! Of course, the treasure might not be that huge, and might be guarded by any number of horrific monsters…\nTo Escape Confinement: The player characters have been captured by an enemy, and find themselves incarcerated without their weapons, armor, or equipment. This scenario must be used with care, as the DM must not be seen to be “railroading” the characters into the adventure.\nThere are many other possible scenarios, and each has many variations. Knowing the answer to this question will make the next questions easier to answer.\n\n\n2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?\nIs the dungeon beneath a ruined fortress, or an ancient wizard’s tower? Or perhaps it’s a natural cave, which has been expanded by kobolds… or the tomb of an ancient barbarian warlord, guarded by undead monsters… there are many possibilities.\n\n\n3. Choose Special Monsters\nNow you know why the player characters want to go there (or why they will, when they learn of the dungeon), and you know what sort of place it is. Next, decide what special monsters you will place within. For instance, the natural cave expanded by kobolds contains kobolds, obviously, while the warlord’s tomb contains some undead, zombies and skeletons perhaps.\n\n\n4. Draw The Dungeon Map\nDungeon maps can be drawn on graph paper in pencil, or created on the computer with any of a broad variety of dungeon-drawing programs. (If you like the design of the maps in the official Basic Fantasy RPG adventure modules, be sure to visit www.basicfantasy.org and try out our map designer, MapMatic +2.) When creating a dungeon for personal use, there is certainly no good reason not to use pencil and paper. Below is an example of a hand-drawn dungeon map, with the various symbols noted:\n\n\n5. Stock The Dungeon\n“Stocking” the dungeon refers to assigning contents to each room. There are several possibilities; a room might contain a monster (which might or might not have treasure), a trap (which might guard a treasure, or might not), an “unguarded” treasure, a “special” (something other than a monster, trap, or treasure; often a puzzle of some sort), or be “empty.”\nThe DM may choose the contents of any room, or may roll on the table below:\n\n\n\nd%\nContents\n\n\n\n\n01-16\nEmpty\n\n\n17-20\nUnguarded Treasure\n\n\n21-60\nMonster\n\n\n61-84\nMonster with Treasure\n\n\n85-88\nSpecial\n\n\n89-96\nTrap\n\n\n97-00\nTrap with Treasure\n\n\n\nAn unguarded treasure will generally be hidden (such as in a secret room, inside an unusual container, etc.) or protected by a trap (a poison needle in the lock of a chest, or a poison gas canister that explodes if the container is opened, or something similar); such a treasure might even be hidden and trapped! Again, some sort of saving throw should be allowed if a trap is used. It’s not a bad idea to hide a treasure so well that the player characters are unlikely to find it; don’t be concerned if they don’t. If you give away the location of all your unguarded treasures, your players will not appreciate it properly when they manage to find one by cleverness or luck.\nA monster might be selected by the DM or rolled on the random encounter tables. It’s traditional that the first level (below ground) contains monsters of 1 hit die or less, the second level contains monsters of around 2 hit dice, and so on, but the DM may choose to arrange his or her dungeon in any way desired.\nA monster with treasure might indicate a lair, or it might be a group of monsters carrying loot, possibly camping for some reason before moving on.\nA trap is, obviously, some sort of device intended to harm the player characters, including such things as pendulum blades, hidden pits, spear-chucking devices, and so forth. A trap with treasure is such a trap protecting a treasure, which might be in the room beyond the trap or actually within it (such as in a pit). See the Traps section, below, for more information.\nA special might be a puzzle of some sort, such as a door that can only be opened by a combination (hidden elsewhere in the dungeon); or perhaps an oracle that answers questions about the dungeon (but possibly it lies). The classic “magic fountain” that randomly changes the ability scores of the drinker is another possibility; if this is done, some sort of limit should be imposed (such as, the device only affects a given creature once, or the device causes harm more often than it gives aid) to prevent abuse. In general, a “special” room is any room containing something that either interests or obstructs the player characters but is not a monster, trap, or unguarded treasure.\nEmpty rooms contain no monsters, traps, unguarded treasures, or specials. This does not mean that they are truly “empty;” a room might contain a fireplace, upholstered chairs, side tables, torch sconces, and curtains, and still be considered empty. Hide a treasure in a secret drawer in a side table, and it becomes an unguarded treasure room; in other words, to be empty there has to be basically nothing of serious interest to the player characters in the room.\n\n\n6. Finishing Touches\nThe DM may wish to create one or more custom wandering monster tables for the dungeon; monster patrols, if any, may need to be described; and possibly some locations may have unusual sounds, smells, graffiti, etc. which need to be noted. Don’t spend too much time on this, though.\nRemember, if you only detail the “interesting” things, your players will begin to guess what might be in a room. Some extra description will help make things uncertain for the players. For instance, a room with an unguarded treasure:\nDungeon Master : This room contains a chest, centered against the far wall.\nPlayer 1: We look for monsters, and if we don’t see any, the thief will check the chest for traps.\nKind of boring, right? This might be better:\nDungeon Master : In this room you see a comfortable-looking upholstered chair, a side table and a foot stool. Two burned-out torches are held by sconces on each wall.\nPlayer 1: If we don’t see any monsters, the thief will check the table and the footstool for traps and see if anything is hidden inside them, while the rest of us check for secret doors… one of those sconces might open one.\nA little extra detail can add a lot to the adventure.\n\n\nTraps\nSome suggestions of typical traps are listed below, to assist the DM. Deadlier traps can be created by combining simple traps, by making their effects harder to avoid, or by making them capable of dealing more damage.\nTraps are not necessarily reliable; the DM may choose to make a roll of some sort for each potential victim until the trap is sprung (say, 1-2 on 1d6). Or, a trap door might not open until a given weight is placed on it, so that a lightly loaded thief might cross without difficulty, only to see his heavily armored warrior ally fall victim to it.\nAlarm: Everyone within a 30’ radius must save vs Spells or be deafened for 1d8 turns by the loud noise. The DM should check immediately for wandering monsters, which, if indicated, will arrive in 2d10 rounds.\nArrow Trap: A hidden, mounted crossbow attacks at AB +1, doing 1d6+1 points of damage on a successful hit.\nChute: These are usually covered with a hidden trap door. The triggering character must save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or tumble down to lower level of the dungeon. Chutes usually do little or no damage to the victim.\nFalling stones or bricks: Rocks fall from the ceiling. The triggering character must save vs. Paralysis or Petrify (with Dexterity bonus added) or take 1d10 points of damage.\nFlashing Light: With a loud snap, a bright light goes off in the face of the character that triggered the trap. That character, and anyone else looking directly at it, must save vs. Spells or be blinded for 1d8 turns.\nMonster-Attracting Spray: A strong-smelling but harmless liquid is sprayed on the triggering character. The smell attracts predatory creatures, doubling the chances of wandering monsters for 1d6 hours or until washed off.\nOil Slick: Oil is sprayed onto the floor of the room. Anyone trying to walk through the oil must save vs Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or fall prone. Oil is highly flammable and may be ignited by torches or other flame sources held by characters who slip and fall into it.\nPit Trap: Usually hidden with a breakable cover, trap door, or illusion. The victim must save vs Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or fall into the pit, taking damage according to the distance fallen (see “Falling Damage”). A pit trap can be made deadlier by placing spikes, acid, or dangerous creatures at the bottom, or partly filling it with water to represent a drowning hazard.\nPoison Dart Trap: A spring-loaded dart launcher attacks at AB +1 for 1d4 points of damage, and the victim must save vs. Poison or die.\nPoison Gas: Gas emerges from vents to fill the room. All within the affected area must save vs. Poison or die. Poison gases are sometimes highly flammable and may be ignited by torches or other flame sources, doing perhaps 1d6 points of damage to each character in the area of effect (with a save vs. Dragon Breath allowed to avoid the damage).\nPoison Needle Trap: A tiny, spring-loaded needle pops out of a keyhole or other small aperture and injects poison into the finger of the character who triggered the trap (most likely, a Thief trying to pick the lock), who must save vs. Poison or die.\nPortcullis: A falling gate blocks the passage. The character who triggered the trap must save vs Death Ray or take 3d6 points of damage.\nRolling Boulder Trap: A spherical or cylindrical rock rolls down a slanting corridor. Anyone in its path must save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or take 2d6 points of damage. Alternately, if the corridor has no other place for the character to escape to (that is, no room for the character to step out of the path of the rock), it may be necessary to outrun the rock to avoid the damage.\nBlade Trap: A blade or spear drops down from the ceiling or pops out of the wall and attacks at AB +1 for 1d8 points of damage. Particularly large blades might attack everyone along a 10’ or 20’ line.\nTriggered Spell: When activated, a spell of the DM’s choice is cast, targeting or centered on the character who triggered it. Popular choices include curses, illusions, or a wall of fire.",

    "section": "Designing a Wilderness Adventure",
    "text": "Designing a Wilderness Adventure\n\n1. Think About Why\nThis is much the same task as was described above. The player characters may enter a particular area looking for a town to resupply from, a church or temple to provide healing services, or for many other reasons. Once in the area, the Dungeon Master can make the player characters aware of adventuring opportunities in the area, by means of rumors, posted bounties (such as for raiding humanoids), quests offered by local clergy, and so forth.\n\n\n2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?\nDecide whether the area is deep in the wilderness, or in more inhabited territories, what sort of climate will be found there, how many towns, and of what size, are present, and so on.\nYou may choose to design a new territory based on the goals of the player characters in your campaign. For example, if the player characters decide to seek their fortunes in the richest city in the world, you could decide where this is and begin to describe it by providing rumors of its wealth and splendor told by far-wandering merchants. If these descriptions intrigue the characters and they travel toward the city, you will have time to decide what terrain – and dangers – lie in their path.\nOn the other hand, your setting should make sense, which will help players make meaningful choices when traveling. For example, areas under human control will be settled, with signs of civilization such as cleared land for agriculture, roads, strongholds, etc. Areas dominated by humanoid monsters, or which are being raided by wandering humanoids, will be battle-scarred and will not have food or other goods available. A valley that was settled many years ago but abandoned after a dragon attacked could contain ruined buildings, their walls likely still bearing the marks of flame and claw, and fields grown high with saplings.\n\n\n3. Draw An Area Map\nNow it’s time to draw the area map. Some Game Masters prefer to draw maps freehand, while others like to use hex or graph paper; of course, programs are available to create maps on a computer as well. It is a good idea to provide a scale for the map, which can be whatever best fits the map and the area you want to depict. A scale of 18 miles per square or hex is a good choice for a large-scale map, as this is the distance that a group of humans can cover in a day in clear terrain (see Wilderness Movement Rates), which makes it easy to determine travel times.\nRivers and coastline, hills and mountains, forests and plains must be clear on the map. All of these areas should have an appropriate climate: for example, the windward side of a mountain range will usually receive a great deal of rain, while the other side will be dry. You may choose to create an area with abnormal weather for its location, such as a sandy desert in the midst of a rain forest, but this should be unusual, a tip to observant players that strange magic is involved.\nGo ahead and place any interesting sites such as towns, ruins, and significant monster lairs. Remember, in most cases your party of adventurers will need some base of operations, be it a city, town, village, or border fortress.\n\n\n4. Detail Interesting Sites And People\nDescribe at least the base town, and the dungeon you expect the party to visit first. Also detail any set or placed encounters you laid out in the step above. There is lots of room for creativity here: a distant, unfamiliar town may have different laws, traditions, or currency. You should also describe key NPCs and their connections to each other. NPCs have their own goals and plans, which may or may not involve the PCs, and the actions of player characters toward one person will often influence how others treat them. Don’t go overboard trying to detail every single place on the map… leave some room for expansion later, after you have a feel for your players and their characters.\n\n\n5. Create Encounter Tables\nWhen designing a wilderness area, one touch that will really set it apart is a custom encounter table. Choose those monsters that seem most appropriate to the area, using the standard encounter tables as a guide. If you have placed humanoid lairs or encampments, you may wish to include their patrols on the custom table.\nAnother alternative is to roll six or eight or ten random encounters using the “generic” encounter table for the relevant terrain type, and use that list as your random encounter table for the area. When doing this, you probably should re-roll duplicates.",

    "text": "Strongholds\nMany player characters, upon reaching higher levels, choose to settle down and build a stronghold. Generally this is allowed when a character reaches 9th level or higher. The player character must obtain land on which to build; in some lands, frontier territory may be made available to any freeman (or freewoman) who can tame it; in others, land may be available for someone with enough gold; while in other cases the character will need to petition the local Count, Duke or King for a land grant.\nUsually, Fighters build castles, Magic-Users build towers, Clerics build temples and Thieves build guildhouses, but this is not always so. Any character who builds a stronghold suitable to his or her class will attract 1st level followers of the same class as follows:\n\n\n\nClass\nNumber of Followers\n\n\n\n\nFighter\n3d6\n\n\nMagic-User\n1d8\n\n\nCleric\n2d8\n\n\nThief\n2d6\n\n\n\nThese followers will assist the character, but will not go on adventures away from the stronghold in most cases (especially dangerous dungeon adventures). They live from the income generated by the stronghold. The primary sources of this income are taxes on peasants for castles, fees for magical services and students’ tuition for towers, tithing from the faithful for temples, and criminal activities for guildhouses. A stronghold must have 200 square feet of living space for each follower, as well as quarters for guests, stables for horses, and so on.\nA player who wants to build a stronghold should draw its floor plan. Each story is usually 10’ tall. The construction costs for the stronghold are determined by the square footage of its walls, floors and roofs, the materials used, and the thickness of the walls.\nMake sure not to double-count corners on walls that are 5’ thick or thicker – count the length of only one face. When determining wall length for round walls and towers, approximate pi by 3, since the inner face of the wall has a shorter circumference. The table below gives costs in gp for each 10’ square section of wall. The number by the material is its hardness, which is deducted from damage to the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall material\n1’ thick\n5’ thick\n10’ thick\n15’ thick\n\n\nMaximum height\n40’\n60’\n80’\n100’\n\n\nWood (H 6)\n10 gp\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nBrick (H 8)\n20 gp\n50 gp\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nSoft stone (H 12)\n30 gp\n70 gp\n200 gp\nn/a\n\n\nHard stone (H 16)\n40 gp\n90 gp\n260 gp\n350 gp\n\n\n\nA 1’ thick wall is made of solid pieces of material held with mortar (or pegs and ropes for wooden walls); such walls may be at most 40’ tall. A 5’ thick wall consists of two 1’ thick walls sandwiching 3’ of earth and rubble; such a wall may be at most 60’ tall. A 10’ thick wall consists of a 4’ thick outer wall and a 2’ thick inner wall sandwiching 4’ of earth and rubble, and may be built up to 80’ tall. A 15’ thick wall consists of a 6’ thick outer wall and a 2’ thick inner wall sandwiching 7’ of earth and rubble; these walls may be built up to 100’ tall. To attain the maximum height, thinner walls can be used on upper stories. For example, an 80 ft. tower must have at least 20’ of 10’ thick walls at the base, but more could be used.\nThe character will have to pay engineering costs for designing the stronghold, and tall structures are more difficult to design and to build. For each portion of the stronghold (wall, tower, and so on), each 10’ of height adds 10% to the costs in both time and money. The DM should feel free to add a multiplier to reflect the difficulties of building in a remote area, obtaining materials, etc. In particular, if materials need to be transported, they require 1 ton of cargo space per 5 gp of wood or stone construction. (The increased weight of stone compensates for its compactness compared to wood.)\nA building over 40’ high must have a solid foundation, and if over 60’ high, it must rest on bedrock.\nA stronghold requires one worker-day of construction labor for every gp it costs to build. Adding more workers reduces construction time, but the time cannot be reduced below the square root of the time for one worker to build the stronghold. Assume that there are 140 working days per year (seven months of 20 working days each) in temperate climates.\nFloors and thatched roofs cost as much and take as long to build as it would take to build the square footage of their bases of 1’ thick wood walls. Wood-shingled roofs cost twice this amount and take twice as long to build, while slate-shingled roofs cost four times as much and take four times as long. (You don’t need to calculate the greater surface area of a pitched roof, since the increased height increases construction costs enough to cover this.)\nThese costs include normal features of construction such as stairs, doors and windows. Interior walls are not included; they are usually 1’ thick. Parapets, which provide cover for defenders atop castle walls and towers, are usually 1’ thick and 5’ high (so they are half-cost).\nNote that guildhouses are almost always built in cities and thus are usually built with 1’ thick exterior walls, but they cost twice as much to build due to the traps and secret passageways that are designed into them. A Magic-User’s tower costs three times as much to build, due to the need for ancient books, alchemical equipment, and other supplies for conducting research.\nFor example, Sir Percy, a 9th-level Fighter, desires to build a 60’ tall square keep (50’ walls with a 10’ peaked slate-shingled roof) that is 50’ square. The keep will have four stories and an attic, and the first story, which will contain the great hall, will be 20’ high. Sir Percy wishes his keep to be strongly built, so he tells his architect to build with hard stone and use 10’ thick walls for the first two stories and 5’ thick walls for the rest. The first and second floors will thus be 30’ square or 900 square feet, and the third and fourth floors will be 40’ square or 1,600 square feet. With a total floor area of 5,000 square feet, Sir Percy’s keep will house him and up to 24 other people (or animals such as horses, which during an attack may be stabled in the great hall!) in acceptable comfort. Its floor plans are shown on the next page.\nThe first floor has 30 (= 5 [for 50’ length] x 2 [for 20’ height] x 4 walls, minus 8 sections double-counted at the corners and 2 sections for the entrance) 10’ square sections of 10’ thick hard stone walls, which cost 7,800 gp, and 9 10’ square sections of floor, which cost 90 gp, for a total cost of 7,890 gp. The second floor is the same as the first, except that the walls are 10’ high and there is no deduction for an entrance, giving a cost of 4,250 gp. The third and fourth floors each require 18 sections of 5’ thick hard stone walls, costing 1,620 gp, and 16 sections of floor, costing 160 gp, for a total of 1,780 gp per floor. The 50’ square roof costs 4 x 25 x 10 = 1,000 gp, and the 40’ square attic floor adds 160 gp. The design calls for a total of 770’ of 1’ thick interior walls and doors, which would cost 30,800 gp if made of hard stone; Sir Percy uses wood, which costs only 7,700 gp. These costs total 24,560 gp, but since the keep is 60’ high, its cost is increased by 60% to 39,296 gp. The keep will require 39,296 worker-days. Sir Percy may employ up to 198 workers to build the keep, in which case it will take 198 working days to build, or a year and three months’ time. Keep in mind what might happen in this time, given that the area is dangerous enough to warrant building a castle.\nDungeons: A stronghold may also have a dungeon excavated under it. A dungeon is an excellent place to store perishable supplies, a good shelter if the castle is overrun, and often incorporates an escape route if all is lost for the castle’s defenders or a secret way out for raids is desired. Magic-Users sometimes encourage monsters to take up residence in their dungeons, as they provide a convenient source of supplies for magical research and help keep away unwanted guests. Use the following figures for skilled workers, such as dwarves or goblins, to create dungeons; double the times for less skilled miners.\n\n\n\nMaterial\nTime for one worker to excavate a 5’ cube\n\n\n\n\nEarth\n5 days (supports are required)\n\n\nSoft stone\n10 days\n\n\nHard stone\n20 days\n\n\n\nStructural strength and breaches: A section of stronghold wall has as many hit points as its base cost in gp (for example, a section of 10’ thick soft stone wall has 200 hit points). Stone and brick walls only take damage from crushing blows, while wood walls are also affected by fire and chopping attacks. If a given section of wall loses all of its hit points, it is breached, allowing attackers to pass through. If a breach occurs on a lower course of wall, there is a 40% chance that the 10’ section above it will be breached by collapse, and a 20% chance that the section below it will be breached. These secondary breaches have the same chances of affecting the next 10’ section above or below them, and so on until the top or bottom course of wall is reached. If a breach occurs on a right or acute corner (90 degrees or less), the chances of breaches double in each direction.\nAttacking a Castle: Siege engines are difficult to aim, but as castles don’t dodge around, each successive shot by a given siege engine with a given crew has an increasing chance of hitting. To reflect this, the first attack on a castle’s walls is made against Armor Class 20; each subsequent attack by that weapon, fired by that crew, at that same point in the wall, is made against an Armor Class one lower than the previous shot, to a minimum AC of 11.\nAttacks on a castle’s defenders are at -4 on the attack roll if they are standing on the parapets, and at -10 if they are behind arrow slits. Since characters defending the castle do move around, the odds of hitting them with a siege engine do not improve from shot to shot. There is an additional -2 on the attack roll for missile attacks if the defenders are more than 20’ higher than the attackers; this is not specifically due to altitude, but rather because the defenders can use more of the wall for cover. The defenders can take advantage of their height by dropping objects on attackers near the castle’s base; these missiles do 2d10 points of damage, but they have a -2 attack penalty if dropped from a height of 30’ or more.\nSiege engines can damage several adjacent characters; roll damage separately for each character in the 10’ square hit by the missile. Of course, the attack roll must be high enough to damage each one; a roll of 19 against characters having Armor Classes of 18 and 20 would hit the former but not the latter.\nA castle may also be attacked by mining. This method of attack involves tunneling under the castle wall, then setting fire to the supports of the tunnel to cause the wall to collapse. It is also slow, and if the castle has a moat, the tunnel must avoid it, which requires that it be dug deeper, requiring twice the time. A mine is dug like a dungeon, and once its supports are fired, the wall above is breached; if the mine is only 5’ wide, there is only a 50% chance of causing a breach.\nFinally, a screw may be used to attack a stronghold. This device, which costs 200 gp, is used to bore through castle walls. A crew of at least eight is required to operate it. It is only used at the base of a wall, and it is usually operated under a sow, or portable roof, as it is slow. (A sow typically costs about 100 gp.) The device does 1d8 points of damage per turn, but it ignores hardness. A breach caused by a screw is small, so it has only half the usual chance of spreading to the next course of wall, unless widened by miners.",

    "text": "Empire of Iuz\n\nDescription\nTo the North West is the terrible Empire of Iuz. Dedicated to self-serving evil and pursuit of power, Iuz’s armies occupy even his own land as if it were a hostile country needing to be conquered. Refugees speak of a road of skulls leading to the capital city, and watchtowers along the road with beacons fed on the fuel of human fat and flesh.\nIuz does not hesitate to prey on the weak and has made several attempts to conquer surrounding realms. His empire currently encompasses the Land of Iuz, the Horned Lands, the Bandit Lands, and the Barren Lands. Few beings have a greater capacity for cruelty than the demigod Iuz. Iuz harbors an undisguised desire to dominate all of the OnceWas like the overking he once served.\nIuz is the son of the witch Iggwilv. Zagyg and the Circle of Eight banished and imprisoned Iuz 200 years ago. Though Iuz is physically absent, he still holds all power.\nOf late, his influence has been inconsistent. Iuz’s servants have more control over some regions of the empire than others. Iuz’s clerics inflict cruelty and torture upon all who oppose them. Iuz tolerates no less than fanaticism and complete obedience. His clerics constantly try to outdo each other in their acts of cruelty and evil. They show their superiority over all other beings by hunting for trophies; rare finds such as unicorns or paladins are truly prized.\nThe clerics create spells and magic items of terrible power and evil nature and travel the world to commit acts of evil and search out Iuz’s enemies. Iuz is served directly by the Boneheart – two tiers (Greater and Lesser) of six advisers each (clerics and wizards), and by the Boneshadow, six spies and evildoers who roam the world. Iuz builds grand temples to himself in his nation-state, but his churches elsewhere are small and secret. He maintains important sites for mass rituals, sacrifices, and other ill deeds in forbidding wilderness terrain far from the eyes of good.\nWith Iuz’s disappearance, some of his more opportunistic followers and a few of his fiends broke away to form the Horned Society.\n“The weak must be exploited, tortured, and stripped of hope. The strong must be constantly wary of betrayal by their underlings. Pain is power, and inflicting pain demonstrates power best. Crush those beneath you. Iuz must be obeyed, and those who defy him will know absolute pain.”\n\n\nPeople\nThe population numbers about 150,000, of which 55% are human. Of the remaining people, 30% are orc or half-orc, 10% are hobgoblin, and the remaining 5% are demonic. Another estimated 10,000 consist of the undead. Common is the predominant language, but Orcish and Demonic are also spoken.\n\n\nReligion\nFor a long time, the only deity worshipped was Iuz himself. Note: The priests of Iuz were able to cast spells again about 10 years after Iuz’s banishment. Recently, cults of Grund-Wyrgen and Nergal have quietly emerged.\n\n\nGovernment\nThe Empire of Iuz is technically an imperial theocratic dictatorship with demigod Iuz recognized as the supreme ruler. Iuz’s priesthood and War Lords manage the affairs of the empire in his name.\n\nThe mad Baron Numenor “rules” Greenreach.\nBaron Dorag the Boneshadow is regent in Fleichshriver.\nLord Baltab the Immortal Orc governs Barad Perras in Narragor.\n\nThe Bandit Lands are loosely allied petty dictatorships, currently “administered” by occupying forces of Iuz. They are usually warlords and mages supposedly in service to Iuz.\nThe Horned Lands are an area of the Horns of the Dragon made up of Hobgoblins, Goblins, Bugbears, and Ogres. It is ruled by Lord Azarr Kul, Hobgoblin cleric of the cult of Tiamat.\n\n\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms features a grinning skull on a black field.\n\n\n\nClimate\nIuz has a cold bleak climate with a great deal of snow and freezing rain. The sun never shines above Dorakaa which is always gloomy and overcast.\n\n\nCities\n\nDorakaa, the capital city of the Empire of Iuz\nFleichshriver\nGreensreach\nStoink\nRookroost\n\n\n\nOther Regions\n\nBarren Lands\nHorned Lands\nBandit Lands",

    "text": "Imladris\n\nDescription\nImladris is a breathtakingly beautiful high elven city deep in the heart of the dense Luisian Forest. Lady Galadriel is the Elven Queen of Imladris, and she is the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remain in OnceWas. Hers is an enchanted, enriched land—a great magic forest into which evil cannot enter without difficulty. It is filled with thundering waterfalls, secluded valleys, colorful alpine meadows, and majestic mountains. Residents are almost exclusively elves, with high elves making up nearly 90% of the population, wood elves 5%, and moon elves 5%.\nThe Elvish Kingdom is protected by thick natural growth, nurtured to create an impenetrable hedge of thickets and brambles stretching out for almost a mile in every direction from the city. It contains an intricate network of secret passages and paths, both within the thicket below and in the branches above, combined with creepers, vines, and lianas that allow the city’s protectors, mostly bladesingers and deft archers, to patrol the city’s perimeter. If confronted by one of these protectors, it is likely that as many as 25 others are hidden and ready to aid their associate.\nThe elves create great works of art, music, and magic, but tend to keep their works within their own community, passing them between each other as gifts. There is no shame in “regifting”; in fact, quite the opposite. Some treasures have accrued a “pedigree” of sorts based on who has given the item to whom in the past—a practice that usually increases its value rather than diminishing it.\nThe Luisian Forest provides everything they need to survive, so they trade with others only very rarely, and only with other elves. As a result, most trade with Imladris flows through Ellesméra.\nGiven the longevity of elves, the high elves have guided the growth of the great trees over the eons. As you pass through the woods to the great river Harp, you see across the water immense trees actually bent into graceful arches, crisscrossed by wooden bridges, with high gleaming windows in the trunks illuminating the rooms within.\nAn immense temple at the center is formed of the trunks of three massive trees twisted together into a great braid, with the branches arching out over the nearest buildings like buttresses. Cypress or mangrove-like trees stretch out over the water, making a living complex of docks.\nThe temple is dedicated to Ki. Within the temple, there are shrines to other deities and spirits that Ki considers to be allies. The city leaders are both well-practiced in the art of magic as well as high priests.\nThe shining city is filled with light. Beautiful Elven music fills the air. The white stone buildings, rails, and structures are laced with elegant twisting branches and leaves. Abundant parks and gardens fill the city, reflecting the Elves’ appreciation of the natural world and its beauty.\n\n\nPeople\nThe population of Imladris numbers about 4,000, of which almost 90% are High Elves, with wood elves (5%) and moon elves (5%) making up the difference.\nElven (Sylvan) is the predominant language. Common is spoken as well.\n\n\nReligion\nThe favored deity is Ki, goddess of life and nature.\n\n\nGovernment\nLady Galadriel is the Elven Queen of Imladris.\n\n\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms features a white tree on a green field.\n\n\n\nClimate\nImladris has a temperate climate.\n\n\nCities\n\nImladris, the capital city of the Elvish Kingdom\nEllesméra, an Elven and Human village and a place where many half-elves live",

A massive navy was built up, and Isigir remains the most powerful fleet in the twelve realms. Today, Isigir is an important trading nation but is also known to encourage piracy. It frequently hinders trade between Dunador, Keoland, and Nyrond.

The demi-goddess Uinen, demi-goddess of merchants, is also worshipped.\n\n\nGovernment\nIsigir is currently ruled by King Castimir the Usurper in Umbar. Castimir is the first King not of Isig’s lineage. Beneath him are nine Sea Lords, the Council of Captains, each in command of one of the nine other cities on the coast of Isigir. Isigir has a powerful navy that frequently hinders trade between Dunador, Keoland, and Nyrond.\n\nCastimir the Usurper was not of the Isig bloodline nor a direct heir to the throne of Isigir. He was a noble of the realm and became the Captain of Ships.\nEven before Eldacar’s ascension, rebellion brewed in Isigir, especially in the southern part where piracy flourished.\nKing Eldacar maintained a difficult and unpopular truce with Dunador. Years of religious and political differences added additional strain. The Sea Lords saw Dunador as a competitor in trade and expansion in the ‘New World’ of the OnceWas.\nWith the support of the nine Sea Lords, Castimir murdered King Eldacar of the House of Isig and claimed the throne in 635 A0M.\nImmediately, King Castimir attacked Dunador and the War of Belmont Bay began.\n\n\n\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms features an orange dragon on a blue field.\n\n\n\nClimate\nIsigir has a tropical climate.

    "text": "Nyrond\n\nDescription\nThe Kingdom of Nyrond, birthed by the illustrious King Nyr, scion of the legendary Overking Accerak, once stood as a bastion of prosperity amid abundant natural riches. Today, however, Nyrond is a realm rent asunder, its lands scarred by the aftermath of bloody conflicts against the Empire of Iuz and the lawless Bandit Lands. The toll is grim: nearly 60,000 lives lost in battle, with twice that number fleeing in desperation, seeking refuge and livelihoods beyond its borders.\nAmidst the fractured realm, morale falters among nobles, soldiers, and the commonfolk alike. Hunger grips the populace, pushing some regions to the brink of starvation, while the kingdom’s once brimming coffers now echo hollowly. Taxation, necessary to fend off the looming threat of Iuz to the north, has become a crushing burden, stoking rebellious flames among peasants and urban dwellers alike. Streets once vibrant with commerce now teem with destitute souls, their neighborhoods overrun by beggars and urchins, symbols of a kingdom in decline.\nIn the heart of this turmoil lies Nyr’s Gate, where authorities pluck bodies from the ocean, grim testimony to the treacherous currents that run beneath the surface of the kingdom. Refugees huddle in impoverished districts, while trade, once the lifeblood of Nyrond, withers under the weight of uncertainty and strife.\nInternally, the vital silver mines of the Flinty Hills stand as a beacon of hope, their bounty, alongside aid from allies such as Keoland, serving as the sole bulwark against Nyrond’s collapse. Yet even here, tensions simmer; the dwarves of Dwarvengarde, nestled deep beneath the Dunatis Mountains, tread cautiously. Led by the wise DwarfLord Kelfex Grommet, these stalwart miners maintain a wary vigilance against potential foes, their autonomy fiercely guarded amidst whispers of political intrigue and distant conflicts.\nBeyond the mountains, within the Plains of the Old Dominion, ancient nomadic tribes of wild elves ride their majestic giant owls, remnants of a time before the Overking’s conquest reshaped the land. Distrust lingers between these elusive tribes and the dwarven enclaves, a fragile balance maintained through cautious diplomacy.\nIn the face of adversity, Nyrond’s coat of arms—a resplendent blue Pegasus soaring against a backdrop of blazing orange—remains a symbol of resilience, a reminder of past glories and the indomitable spirit that yet flickers in the kingdom’s depths. Amidst its temperate climes and storied cities like Rel Mord and High Vale, Nyrond stands at a crossroads, where the echoes of history mingle with the uncertainty of its future—a realm where every dawn brings both promise and peril, and where the fate of thousands hangs in the balance.\n\n\nPeople\nThe population numbers about 200,000, of which 89% are human. Of the remaining people, 4% are wood elves from the Celadon Forest, 6% are dwarves (living in the Dunatis Mountains), and the remaining 1% are other races. Common is the predominant language.\n\n\nReligion\nThe favored deity is Brigit, goddess of fire. The demi-god Girru, demi-god of volcanoes and fire, is also worshipped.\n\n\nGovernment\n\nLynwerd of Aerdi and the house of Nyr is King of Nyrond.\n\n\n\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms features a blue Pegasus on an orange field.\n\n\n\nClimate\nNyrond has a temperate climate.\n\n\nCities\n\nRel Mord, the capital city of Nyrond\nDurheim\nOerik\nNyr’s Gate\nPort of Karereca\nBrindol\nHighVale\nTellerton\nDrellin’s Ferry",

    "text": "Pomarj\n\nDescription\nOnce this area was a Keolandish penal colony. It was called the Poor March then and it was a hostile land filled with orcs and ogres. The orc, Turrosh Mak, led a revolt against the Keolandish governor and his men, and Turrosh Mak reclaimed the land, renaming it the Pomarj as it is known today.\nThe Pomarj is a large peninsula located to the south. It was well known to be overrun by humanoid tribes and considered by most to be a wretched hive of scum and villainy.\nHowever, of all of the OnceWas, the Pomarj is the most open melting pot of races in the Realm. There are still some dwarven miners living in villages along with orcs, goblins, and humans. A thriving black market run by human pirates has been the backbone of the Pomarj economy. While most consider this to be a place of outlaws, there are many who recognize that this is the only place in the OnceWas where human and demi-humans live together successfully.\nA tavern in High Port called the Temple is legendary. All are welcome there.\nTurrosh Mak is able to pass if disguised as an ugly human. When addressing his orcish followers, he also disguises himself and wears orcish war regalia in order to look more like one of them. He is tall and strong-bodied, but is starting to go gray at his temples. He is an intelligent and ruthless warrior, a survivor who will use any dirty trick at his disposal to stay alive.\nTurrosh Mak is a founding member of the Slave Lords and is still closely allied with their present incarnation. He has pledged himself to Grund-Wyren in return for power and is thus allied with that god’s cult.\nTurrosh Mak was formerly known as Theg Narlot. In 569 CY he joined a secret brotherhood assembled by Stalman Klim named the Nine. Later it would be renamed the Slave Lords. In 574 CY, the Nine assassinated King Rodric of Suderham; as the group’s assassin, presumably Theg Narlot executed the man himself. Within a matter of hours, the Nine had taken over the city. For four years, the Slave Lords kidnapped and sold slaves all around the Sea of Gearnat. In 580 CY, a band of adventurers attempted to defeat the Slave Lords. The city of Suderham from which they ruled was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Flamenblut. Theg Narlot disappeared into the Pomarj, but reemerged in the early 580s as Turrosh Mak, who used a combination of judicious assassinations and brute military force to unite the humanoid tribes of the region and forge them into a kingdom.\nIn Readying of 584 CY, Despot Mak sent his troops to conquer the southern Wild Coast and the eastern Principality of Ulek.\nTurrosh Mak, blood of Krugur Mak, great reaver and bane to civil kind, chief of the Fire Skulls tribe, is now his Most Ferocious Majesty who holds rule over all Pomarj tribes. He leads with a brute force and cruel intelligence unseen in centuries. Standing nearly 7 feet in height and of gigantic girth, Turrosh’s presence alone commands respect and fear from the most fierce of warriors amongst the Pomarj Tribes. Having slain his own brethren, and challenged and defeated his own father Krugur, he succeeded to the right. With his own specifically chosen warriors, he acquired control-first of the Fire Skulls, then one by one, convinced chieftains through bloody ordeals or savagely conquered the other tribes. His is a leadership and control style unheard of amongst orc and goblin-kind. His word became law, his name demanded obedience, his tribe is now a banner to follow.\nOf late, Turrosh has taken elven captives and through means of torture and false promise, learned their elf tongue and glyphs. When finished with them, he discarded their lives to the wolf pits, much to the entertainment of his subjects.\nHe is known to have taken several mates, be they wanting kin or captured slave, and has spawned many offspring to ensure his blood populates his empire.\nTired of being suppressed, Turrosh has decided the time has come for a new rule for the lands within …and without!\n\n\nPeople\nThe population numbers about 85,000, of which 25% are Orc, 20% Human, 20% Goblin, 20% are Dwarves, 5% are halflings, and the remaining 10% are other races including Ogre, Hobgoblin, Bugbear, Gnoll, Hill Giant, Gnome, Drow, and Lizardman.\nOrcish, Common, and Dwarven (Underspeak) are spoken here.\n\n\nReligion\nSiduri, goddess of beer and wine, is the patron goddess of the Pomarj (Demi God: Morrigan, demi-goddess of luck and thieves).\n\n\nGovernment\nKing Turrosh Mak the Terrible is the oddly charismatic half-orc ruler of the Pomarj. Some consider him an evil despot. Others depict Turrosh Mak as an enlightened and brilliant leader.\n\n\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms features a red Medusa on a white field.\n\n\n\nClimate\nThe Pomarj has a tropical climate. There is a rainy season during the start of the summer when violent thunderstorms are prevalent.\n\n\nCities\n\nHighPort, the capital city of The Pomarj\nObsidian Bay\nOstrand Keep\nStorm Tower\nSpindrift Isles",

They value strength and embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Civilization, education, and arcane magic are seen as weaknesses. The barbarians thrive in the snowy wilds of their homeland.\nMost of the clans are composed of fighters, with some spellcasters among them, primarily druids and clerics of Enlil. The United Clans are in constant war with Glantri. Periodically, they undertake the “sailing the horn,” a raiding journey down the Anduin, around the Isigir, and up the wild coast, attacking settlements along the way. This journey typically lasts about six months and is considered a rite of passage for warriors.\n\n\nPeople\nThe population of Stone Hold numbers less than 100,000, with 90% humans and 10% dwarves living in the Corrusk Mountains.\n\n\nReligion\nThe favored deity of Stone Hold is Enlil, the god of war.

During his reign, advancements in architecture, agriculture, and trade allowed the Great Kingdom to flourish for over a hundred years.\nAs time passed, the OverKing became corrupt and evil. Perhaps he was manipulated by his advisor Iuz, or driven mad by arcane longevity. The OverKing became withdrawn from the world, and Iuz ruled as his regent.\nIuz’s rule was chaotic and cruel, a parasite over the Great Kingdom. The human fiefs rose up against him. The houses of Dun, Isig, Nyr, Keo, and Glant rebelled against the necromancer, marking the beginning of the Great War.\nThe Great Kingdom fell quickly. Iuz created an empire in the North. The House of Dun raised the banner of Dunador, while Glantry, Keoland, and Isigir rose as individual kingdoms.\nIuz’s necromancy continued to grow in strength, using dark rituals to steal power and life force. Once beautiful, Iuz now appeared gnarled and old, considered the enemy of every sane and free person in OnceWas. His tyranny ended when an alliance of wizards used a powerful magic device to imprison him in the Far Realm.\nHundreds of years have passed, and the people of OnceWas barely remember Acererak, the Great Kingdom, or Iuz. All that remain are strange ruins and old ghosts.\nHistory of OnceWas movie",
