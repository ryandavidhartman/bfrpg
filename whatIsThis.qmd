The Divine Scimitars and the Tomb of Endless Wagers

The torches sputtered in the damp corridor as Vakesh ran a hand along the carved wall, tracing ancient sigils worn nearly smooth. “Luck favors the bold,” he muttered, though his tone carried the unease of a man who had wagered his last coin on that truth one too many times.

Behind him, Torin adjusted his grip on his war axe. “Luck favors the prepared,” the dwarf growled. “And you’ve yet to pay me back for the last round of ale, wizard.”

Carisby, ever the opportunist, snorted and crouched beside a stone chest half-buried in dust. “If it makes you feel better, Torin, I’m about to find us all a payday.” His nimble fingers danced across the lock—click—and a faint mist hissed from the seams.

Rosalin stepped forward, mace ready, eyes narrowing as the vapor thickened. “Trap. Back!”

Too late—the halfling sprang back, coughing as the air shimmered with necrotic energy. The runes on the chest flared green, and a figure of light rose before them: a skeletal priest in tattered finery, holding a pair of dice carved from bone.

“Roll… and your fate is sealed,” it rasped.

Vakesh’s grin returned. “Now this is a game I understand.”

He reached into his robes and produced a pair of gem-inlaid dice—an old gambler’s charm from his wilder years. As they clattered across the flagstones, the undead priest mirrored the motion. The two sets rolled in eerie unison.

The priest’s dice came up snake eyes. Vakesh’s—double sixes.

A sudden rush of spectral wind blew through the corridor. The ghostly priest bowed stiffly, fading into dust. The chest’s lid cracked open with a low moan, revealing a heap of ancient gold coins and a ring that shimmered faintly with unholy light.

Torin whistled low. “Ain’t often I see the gods smile on a cheat.”

Rosalin frowned, her cleric’s instincts uneasy. “That ring—best leave it be. Evil clings to it.”

Carisby was already pocketing the coins. “Evil can wait till after supper.”

Vakesh eyed the ring but said nothing. The dice in his palm felt unusually warm. He smiled a gambler’s smile—the kind that hides more than it shows.

“Onward, Scimitars,” he said. “The night is young, and fortune’s still rolling.”

They disappeared deeper into the tomb, laughter echoing through the corridors—reckless, brilliant, and utterly free.

## What Is This?

The **Old School D&D Role-Playing Game** is a tabletop system inspired by the earliest fantasy role-playing games. It celebrates the gritty charm of “old-school” mechanics—rooted in sword-and-sorcery tales—where danger is real, treasure is hard-won, and every dungeon crawl holds both peril and wonder.

## What Is a Role-Playing Game?

In the almost 50 years since the first role-playing game appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard of one or two such games, and many have played. Still, some have not tried RPGs; if you are one of those people, this part is for you.

Role-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly two to eight, and a Dungeon Master  (DM), who is responsible for running the world, creating and managing the towns, nations, ruins, non-player characters (NPCs), monsters, treasure, and all other elements that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to determine the success or failure of actions in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral dice for this purpose.

In essence, role-playing games are grown-up games of pretend, with rules to determine outcomes. These rules range from very free-form and simple to very complex and detailed.

This game attempts to balance simplicity and complexity, being neither too detailed nor too free-form.

## What Do I Need to Play?

As a player, you should have a pencil, some notebook paper, and a set of dice. Graph paper is also useful for drawing maps. You can use preprinted character sheets available on the Basic Fantasy RPG website, but notebook paper works fine.

As the Dungeon Master , you need the same materials. For new DMs or those with limited preparation time, pre-written adventures (modules) are available for free on the [basicfantasy.org](https://www.basicfantasy.org/) website. Modules written for most OSR games can also be used with some conversion.

## Using the Dice

The 20-sided die (d20) is used to resolve attack rolls and saving throws. The 10-sided die (d10) generates numbers from 1 to 10, and pairs are used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100 (percentile rolls). The 4-sided die (d4) is flipped rather than rolled. Other commonly used dice include the 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), and 12-sided die (d12).
