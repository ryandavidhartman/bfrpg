The Divine Scimitars and the Tomb of Endless Wagers

The torches sputtered in the damp corridor as Vakesh ran a hand along the carved wall, tracing ancient sigils worn nearly smooth. “Luck favors the bold,” he muttered, though his tone carried the unease of a man who had wagered his last coin on that truth one too many times.

Behind him, Torin adjusted his grip on his war axe. “Luck favors the prepared,” the dwarf growled. “And you’ve yet to pay me back for the last round of ale, wizard.”

Carisby, ever the opportunist, snorted and crouched beside a stone chest half-buried in dust. “If it makes you feel better, Torin, I’m about to find us all a payday.” His nimble fingers danced across the lock—click—and a faint mist hissed from the seams.

Rosalin stepped forward, mace ready, eyes narrowing as the vapor thickened. “Trap. Back!”

Too late—the halfling sprang back, coughing as the air shimmered with necrotic energy. The runes on the chest flared green, and a figure of light rose before them: a skeletal priest in tattered finery, holding a pair of dice carved from bone.

“Roll… and your fate is sealed,” it rasped.

Vakesh’s grin returned. “Now this is a game I understand.”

He reached into his robes and produced a pair of gem-inlaid dice—an old gambler’s charm from his wilder years. As they clattered across the flagstones, the undead priest mirrored the motion. The two sets rolled in eerie unison.

The priest’s dice came up snake eyes. Vakesh’s—double sixes.

A sudden rush of spectral wind blew through the corridor. The ghostly priest bowed stiffly, fading into dust. The chest’s lid cracked open with a low moan, revealing a heap of ancient gold coins and a ring that shimmered faintly with unholy light.

Torin whistled low. “Ain’t often I see the gods smile on a cheat.”

Rosalin frowned, her cleric’s instincts uneasy. “That ring—best leave it be. Evil clings to it.”

Carisby was already pocketing the coins. “Evil can wait till after supper.”

Vakesh eyed the ring but said nothing. The dice in his palm felt unusually warm. He smiled a gambler’s smile—the kind that hides more than it shows.

“Onward, Scimitars,” he said. “The night is young, and fortune’s still rolling.”

They disappeared deeper into the tomb, laughter echoing through the corridors—reckless, brilliant, and utterly free.

## What Is This?

The **Old School D&D Role-Playing Game** is a tabletop system inspired by the earliest fantasy role-playing games. It celebrates the gritty charm of old-school mechanics, rooted in the sword-and-sorcery tradition where danger is real, treasure is hard-won, and every dungeon crawl brims with both peril and wonder.

## What Is a Role-Playing Game?

In the more than fifty years since the first role-playing game appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard of one or two such games, and many have played them. Still, some have yet to try an RPG; if you’re one of those people, this section is for you.

A role-playing game is played by a group of players—typically two to eight and a **Dungeon Master (DM)**, who runs the world. The DM creates and manages towns, dungeons, nations, non-player characters (NPCs), monsters, treasures, and all other elements that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to determine whether actions succeed or fail; **Old School D&D** uses polyhedral dice for this purpose.

At its heart, a role-playing game is a structured game of make-believe—grown-up pretend—with rules to guide the outcomes of the players’ choices. These rules may be simple and flexible or detailed and complex, depending on the game.

This system aims to capture the spirit of how D&D was played in the early 1980s while refining and modernizing the rules for today’s tables.

## What Do I Need to Play?

As a player, you’ll need a pencil, some notebook paper, and a set of dice. Graph paper is useful for mapping your adventures. You can use a [pre-printed character sheet](char_sheet.qmd) or simply make your own on notebook paper.

As the Dungeon Master, you’ll need the same materials. For new DMs or those with limited preparation time, pre-written adventures (modules) are freely available at [basicfantasy.org](https://www.basicfantasy.org/). Modules written for most other OSR systems can also be adapted with minimal conversion.

## Using the Dice

The 20-sided die (**d20**) is used for attack rolls and saving throws.  
The 10-sided die (**d10**) generates numbers from 1 to 10; rolling two together produces numbers from 1 to 100 (percentile rolls).  
The 4-sided die (d4) is rolled, and the result is read from the number facing up.
Other dice commonly used include the **d6**, **d8**, and **d12**.
