There are men and women who make their living dealing death from the shadows. These people are called assassins. Most are trained by secret guilds or societies; civilized lands generally forbid and destroy such organizations. 

Assassins must abide by the same weapon and armor restrictions as Thieves.  A prospective Assassin must have a minimum Dexterity and Intelligence of 9 each.  Only Humans may become Assassins.

Assassins have several special abilities, as listed on the table below.  Some abilities are shared with the Thief class, and are described in the Core Rules.  Those abilities special to the Assassin class are as follows: 

**Poison**:  Assassins learn the art of making lethal poisons. Poisons are often quite expensive to make; it is not uncommon for a single application of contact poison to cost 500 gp or more.  The DM is advised to take care that poison does not become too much of an easy solution for the Assassin. 

**Assassinate**:  This is the Assassin's primary special ability. As with the Thief's Sneak Attack ability, any time an Assassin is behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know he or she is there, an attempt to assassinate may be made.  The attack must be carried out with a one-handed piercing weapon, such as a dagger or sword.  The attack is rolled at an attack bonus of +4, and if the attack hits, the victim must roll a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be instantly killed.  If this saving throw is a success, the victim still suffers normal weapon damage.  At the GM's option, characters two or more levels lower than the Assassin may be denied a saving throw.



**Waylay**:  An Assassin can attempt to knock out an opponent in a single strike.  This is performed in much the same way as the Assassinate ability, but the Assassin must be using a weapon that does subduing damage normally (i.e. a club or cudgel).  The attack is rolled at a +4 attack bonus; if the Assassin hits, the victim must make a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be knocked unconscious. If this roll is made, the victim still suffers normal subduing damage.  Creatures knocked unconscious by a Waylay attack will remain that way for 2d8 turns if not awakened. 

Note that bounty hunters are often Assassins, who use the Waylay ability in the course of their (more or less) lawful activities.

### Class Descriptiom

The new class described in this supplement is considered a subclass of the Fighter.  As such, it has the same attack bonus and saving throws as a Fighter of the same level. Barbarians should be treated as a Fighter for all purposes, unless otherwise noted.

| 15    | 1,200,000   | 9d10+12   |
| 16    | 1,350,000   | 9d10+14   |
| 17    | 1,500,000   | 9d10+16   |

| 19    | 1,800,000   | 9d10+20   |
| 20    | 1,950,000   | 9d10+22   |

**Requirements**: In order to qualify to be a Barbarian, a character requires a Strength of 9 or higher, a Dexterity of 9 or higher, and a Constitution of 9 or higher.  The class is open to Dwarves, Humans, as well as Half-Ogres and Half-Orcs if those options are available. 

Barbarians may use any armor or shields, and may wield any weapons desired.

Barbarians wearing no armor or at most leather armor may employ the following abilities:



**Alertness**: Only a Thief one or more levels higher than the Barbarian can use their Backstab ability on the Barbarian. 

**Animal reflexes**: The Barbarian can be surprised only on a roll of 1 on 1d6. 

**Hunter**: In the wilderness Barbarians can surprise enemies on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. 

**Runner**: The Barbarian adds 5' to his or her tactical movement. 

Barbarians have one additional special ability they can always use, regardless of armor worn:

**Rage**: Once per day a Barbarian can fly into a Rage, which will last ten rounds.  While raging, a Barbarian cannot use any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he or she activate magic items of any kind (including potions).  Of course, magic items with a continuous effect (like a **Ring of Protection**) continue to function.

While raging, the Barbarian must charge directly into combat with the nearest recognizable enemy.  If no enemy is nearby, the Barbarian must end his or her rage (see below) or else attack the nearest character. 

While raging, the character temporarily gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws versus mind-altering spells, but suffers a penalty of -2 to armor class. 

The Barbarian may prematurely end his or her rage with a successful save vs. Spells. 

At the end of the rage, the Barbarian loses the rage modifiers and becomes fatigued, suffering a penalty of -2 to attack rolls, damage, armor class, and saving throws. While fatigued, the Barbarian may not charge nor move at a running rate.  This state of fatigue lasts for an hour. 

A Barbarian may use this ability up to two times per day at 6^th^ level and three times per day at 12^th^ level.

Illusionists are "specialist" Magic-Users who focus on the creation and manipulation of illusions, whether visual, auditory, or mental, and at higher levels quasi-real things made of tangible shadow. Though "normal" Magic-Users can create illusions, those created by a true Illusionist are superior in quality and realism.

The Prime Requisite for an Illusionist is Intelligence. The Illusionist is required to have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher. Illusionists are poor fighters, with fighting ability equivalent to normal Magic-Users. Likewise they are no more hardy than standard Magic-Users (d4 hit die). They may not wear any armor of any sort or use shields. Like other Magic-Users, they can utilize a walking staff (or cudgel) or dagger, and of course they may use magical weapons of those types. Otherwise, Illusionists can generally be treated as equivalent to Magic-Users for any situation not covered here.

Because of their expertise at creating and understanding illusions, Illusionists always gain an additional +2 on saves vs. any sort of illusion or phantasm.

Illusionists produce magic much like other types of Magic-Users, but have different spell choices. They can learn spells from each other so long as the spells are available to both classes. Like other Magic-Users, a first level Illusionist begins play knowing **read magic** and one other spell of first level, recorded within a spell book. The DM may roll for the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player to choose it, at his or her option. See the **Illusionist Spells** section below for more details.

### Illusionist Spells

Illusionists cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and will, exactly as normal Magic-Users. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each Illusionist has his or her own spellbook, containing the magical formulae for each spell the Illusionist has learned, written in a magical script that can only be read by the Illusionist who wrote it, or through the use of a special first-level spell: **read magic**. All Illusionists begin play with **read magic** as their first spell, and it is so ingrained that an Illusionist can prepare it without a spellbook. **Read magic** has a range of "touch" and is permanent with respect to any given magical work (spellbook or scroll).

Illusionists may learn spells by being taught directly by another Illusionist or by studying another Illusionist's spellbook. The Illusionist may also learn appropriate spells from standard Magic-Users (or other arcane casters, if used); the spell always being at the level as it appears on the Illusionist Spell List. Likewise, a Magic-User may learn spells shared by the classes from an Illusionist. If being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day; researching another Illusionist's spellbook takes one day per spell level. Either way, the spell learned must be transcribed into the Illusionist's own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per spell level transcribed. A beginning Illusionist starts with a spellbook containing **read magic** and at least one other first-level spell, as determined by the Dungeon Master , at no cost.

Spells in **bold** are new to this supplement. Spells with an asterisk (*) following the name are reversible.

### Description of New Spells


####  **Advanced Illusion** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 4 

Duration: 1 minute / level

This spell functions like the spell **spectral force** except that the illusion follows a script determined by the caster. The illusion follows the script without requiring the caster to concentrate on it. If the illusion includes intelligible speech, however, such speech is likewise scripted, so the illusion will not respond if spoken to.

#### **Alter Self** 

Range: self

Illusionist 2 

Duration: 10 minutes / level

This spell allows the caster to assume the form of a creature of the same body type (i.e. humanoid). The new form must be within 50% of his or her normal size. The assumed form can't have more hit dice than the caster's level, nor more than 5 HD at most. The caster can change into a member of his or her own kind or even into him- or herself.

The caster retains his or her own ability scores, class, level, hit points, attack bonus and saving throws. If the new form is capable of speech, he or she can communicate normally and cast spells. The caster acquires the physical qualities of the new form, including armor class, movement capabilities (such as climbing, swimming and flight, but not including magical movement abilities such as **levitation**), natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial abilities, and any gross physical qualities (wings, additional extremities, etc).

Using alter self does not permit additional attacks, and the caster does not gain any special, supernatural, or spell-like abilities of the new form.

#### **Audible Glamer** 

Range: 60' + 10' / level

Illusionist 1 

Duration: 2 rounds / level

**Audible glamer** allows the caster to creates a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed location. The caster chooses what type of sound he or she creates when casting the spell, and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.

The volume of sound created is equivalent to the noise of two normal Humans per caster level. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise an **audible glamer** spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as six Humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from twelve humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from twenty Humans.

Note that this spell is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with **phantasmal force**.

If a character states that he or she does not believe the sound, a save vs. Spells is made; if the save succeeds, the character hears the sound as distant and obviously fake.

#### **Blur** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 2 

Duration: 1 minute / level

When a **blur** spell is cast, the caster causes the outline of the creature touched to appear blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee combat attacks to be made at -4 on the first attempt and ‑2 on all successive attacks. It also grants a +1 on the saving throw die roll against any direct magical attack.

A **detect invisible** spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a **true seeing** spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

#### **Change Self** 

Range: self

Illusionist 1 

Duration: 1 turn / level

This spell allows the caster to alter his or her appearance. This includes not only body shape and facial features, but also clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. The caster can seem up to one foot shorter or taller, and may appear thin, fat, or any size in between. This spell cannot change the overall body shape of the caster (to look like a dog, for example). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to the caster.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the caster or his equipment.

A creature that interacts with the caster may, at the discretion of the GM, be allowed a save vs. Spells to recognize the illusion.

#### **Color Cloud** 

Range: 40' (see text)

Illusionist 3 

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell is similar to **color spray**. It causes a vivid cloudof clashing colors which cause living creatures in the area of effect (or who enter the area of effect) to become blinded or possibly even unconscious. The cloud covers an area up to 20 feetsquare or 20 feet in diameter, as chosen by the caster. Each creature within the cloud is affected according to its hit dice:

-   4 HD or less: The creature becomes unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then is blinded for 1d4 rounds.

-   5to 8 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds.

-   9 or more HD: The creature is blinded for 1 round.

All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster, or having 10 or more levels or hit dice in any case, are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell.

#### **Color Spray** 

Range: 20' (see text)

Illusionist 1 

Duration: instantaneous

This spell causes a vivid cone of clashing colors to be projected from the caster's hands, causing living creatures in the area of effect to become blinded or possibly unconscious. The cone has a 5-foot diameter at the base, 20-foot diameter at the end, and is 20 feet long. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its hit dice:

-   2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then blinded for 1d4 rounds.

-   3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds.

-   5 or more HD: The creature is blinded for 1 round.

All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster, or having 6 or more levels or hit dice in any case, are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray.

#### **Dancing Lights** 

Range: 40' + 10' / level

Illusionist 1 

Duration: 2 rounds / level

Depending on the version of the spell selected, the caster creates up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape.

The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as the caster desires, up to 100 feet per round. Note that concentration is not required; if ignored, the lights continue to move as they were moving when the caster last directed them. If the lights pass beyond the maximum range, the spell ends immediately.

#### **Detect Illusion** 

Range: 60'

Illusionist 2 

Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to recognize illusions by sight. To the caster, all illusions within the given range appear slightly translucent and obviously fake. **Detect illusion** allows detection of visual illusions only; it does not detect auditory illusions such as **audible glamer**.

#### **Dispel Illusion** 

Range: 120'

Illusionist 2 

Duration: instantaneous

The caster can use this spell to end all ongoing "illusion spells" within a 20-foot cubic area. **Dispel illusion** affects spells such as **audible glamer**, **phantasmal image**, **phantasmal force**, **spectral force**, **advanced illusion**, and so on. If there is any question as to whether or not a spell is an illusion, the GM's discretion will apply.

Any illusion spell cast by a character of a level equal to or less than the **dispel illusion** caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance of failure for each level the illusion's caster level exceeds the **dispel illusion** caster level. For example, a 10^th^-level caster dispelling an illusion created by a 14^th^ level caster has a 20% chance of failure.

When an Illusionist attempts to dispel an illusion cast by a non-Illusionist, the Illusionist is treated as if he or she were two levels higher; if it is not obvious whether the illusion was created by an Illusionist or not, the DM should assume it was.

Non-illusion spells cannot be ended by this spell.

#### **Displacement** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 3 

Duration: 2 rounds / level

When a **displacement** spell is cast, the caster causes the creature touched to appear 2 feet away from its actual position. This distortion causes all missile and melee combat attacks to be made at -4 on all attacks. It also grants a +2 on the saving throw die roll against any direct magical attack.

A **detect invisible** spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a **true seeing** spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own)..

#### **Dream** 

Range: see text

Illusionist 5 

Duration: Special

This spell allows the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send a recipient a message through the recipient's dreams. When the spell is cast, the caster must identify the recipient in an unambiguous way. The messenger (whether the caster or someone else) then appears in the recipient's dream and then delivers the message. The message is purely one-way, and there is no opportunity for questions or interaction. When the recipient wakes up, they will remember the message perfectly.

After casting the spell, the messenger is helpless and completely unaware of their surroundings until the spell ends. If the recipient is awake when the spell is cast, the messenger can either end the spell immediately or wait until the recipient goes to sleep. Once the recipient goes to sleep, the message can be delivered. Whether the messenger has to wait or not, the messenger immediately becomes fully aware again once the message is delivered. Creatures who do not sleep cannot be a recipient of this spell.

#### **False Vision** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 6 

Duration: 1 hour / level

Any attempt to observeanything within the area of this spell from most kinds of scrutiny will fail. Those looking into the area see a false image (as the spell **advanced illusion**), as defined by the caster at the time of the casting. As long as the duration lasts, the caster can concentrate to change the image as desired. While not concentrating, the image remains static. Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally. Anyone inside the affected area are immune to **ESP** spells.

Divination spells like **magic mirror**, **clairvoyance**, and **clariaudience** cannot perceive anything within the area. **False vision** does not stop creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area, but they will likely need to disbelieve the illusion before they try.

#### **Gaze Reflection** 

Range: 0

Illusionist 1 

Duration: 1 round / level

The spell creates a mirror like image in the air in front of the caster's face. Any gaze attack, such as that from a basilisk or a medusa, will be reflected back upon the attacker when it looks at the caster.

#### **Hypnotic Pattern** 

Range: 120'

Illusionist 2 

Duration: concentration

A shifting pattern of light moves through the air mesmerizing those who look at it. Roll 2d6 plus the caster level to determine how many HD are affected by the spell. Creatures with the smallest hit dice are affected first, and among those with the same HD, those closest to the effect are affected first. HD of effect that are not sufficient to affect the next creature are wasted. Affected creatures will stop and watch the effect until the duration expires or they are threatened. Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this spell.

The effect continues for 2 rounds after the caster stops concentrating on the spell.

#### **Illusory Script** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 3 

Duration: Permanent

This spell allows the caster to write whatever they want on whatever they want. The caster specifies who they want to read it. (This can be an individual, class of individuals, a group, etc.) For anyone else this appears to be an unintelligible magical writing of some kind, though an Illusionist will recognize it as an Illusory Script.

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script must save vs. Spells or fall under the effects of a Suggestion. The Suggestion only applies for 30 minutes and must be very short and simple (for example, "Put this down and leave").

#### **Illusory Wall** 

Range: 60'

Illusionist 3 

Duration: Permanent

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, covering up to a 10-foot square area, up to 1 foot thick. The section of wall created appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search may reveal the true nature of the surface; the DM may either allow a save vs. Spells to detect the illusion, or if the probing attempt is well devised the DM may allow it to automatically succeed. In either case, such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.

#### **Improved Invisibility** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 4 

Duration: 1 round / level

This spell works exactly like **invisibility**, except that it does not end if the subject attacks or casts a spell.

#### **Mass Invisibility** 

Range: 240'

Illusionist 6 

Duration: Special

Magic-User 7

This spell bestows the effect of an **invisibility** spell on all creatures within a 30-foot by 30-foot area. Each subject will remain invisible until he or she attacks or casts a spell. A subject that leaves the original area of effect remains invisible.

#### **Mass Suggestion** 

Range: 30'

Illusionist 6 

Duration: up to 1 hour / level

This spell bestows the effect of a **suggestion** spell on all creatures within a 30-foot by 30-foot area. The single suggestion applies to all of the targets. Each target gets its own saving throw.

#### **Maze** 

Range: 60'

Illusionist 6 

Duration: 1 turn (see text)

By means of this spell, the caster banishes the target creature into an extra-dimensional labyrinth. Once per round, the victim of this spell may attempt a save vs. Spells to escape the labyrinth. If the victim does not escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the victim at that time.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the target creature reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as **teleport** or **dimension door**, do not help a creature escape a **maze** spell.

Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

#### **Mirage Arcana** 

Range: 120'

Illusionist 5 

Duration: instantaneous

This spell works as **hallucinatory terrain**, except that any kind of terrain may be re-imaged, including terrain, structures, and equipment. This allows buildings to be hidden or added, and other equipment to be hidden or shown. Creatures, however, cannot be disguised or concealed, though they may always hide themselves within the illusion just as they could hide were the illusory terrain real. This spell requires a full turn to cast.

#### **Mislead** 

Range: 100'

Illusionist 5 

Duration: Special

The caster becomes invisible (as if by means of **improved invisibility**) and at the same time an illusory double of him or her appears (as if by means of **spectral force**). The caster is then free to go elsewhere while his or her double moves away. The double appears within the given range, but thereafter moves as the caster directs it (which requires concentration). The double may be controlled at any distance from the caster, so long as the caster remains able to see it.

The caster can make the double appear superimposed perfectly over his or her body so that observers don't notice an image appearing when the caster turns invisible. The caster and the double can then move in different directions. The double moves at the caster's speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as the caster concentrates upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After the caster ceases concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The improved invisibility lasts for 1 round per caster level, regardless of concentration.

#### **Nightmare** 

Range: see text

Illusionist 5 

Duration: instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to send a horrific phantasmal vision through the recipient's dreams. When the spell is the caster must identify the recipient in an unambiguous way. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage to the recipient. They are then unable regain spells again for 24 hours. The recipient is allowed a saving through vs. Spells, which can be modified by how well the caster knows the recipient and if the caster has some token connected to the recipient.

If **dispel evil** is cast on the recipient while this spell is being cast, the nightmare is dismissed with no effect and the caster is paralyzed for 1 turn per level of the caster performing the **dispel evil**.

If the recipient is awake when the spell is cast, the caster can either end the spell immediately or wait in a trance until the recipient goes to sleep. Once the recipient goes to sleep, the message can be delivered. Whether the caster has to wait or not, the caster immediately becomes fully aware again once the message is delivered. The caster is completely helpless physically and mentally while in the trance. Creatures who do not sleep cannot be a recipient of this spell..

#### **Obscurement** 

Range: 100' + 10' / level

Illusionist 2 

Duration: 10 minutes / level

A bank of fog up to a 20' cube in volume billows out from the point the caster designates. The cloud moves at a rate of 10 feet per round under the control of the caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it). The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet; beyond that all creatures will be effectively blind.

The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it, but a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round. This spell does not function underwater.

#### **Permanent Illusion** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 6 

Duration: Permanent

This spell functions much like **advanced illusion** except that the spell is permanent. The "script" for this spell simply repeats endlessly.

#### **Phantasmal Image** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 1 Duration: concentration

This spell is often the first spell an Illusionist will learn. The spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of a 20-foot cube. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, temperature, or movement. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.

A save vs. Spells may be granted by the DM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.

#### **Phantasmal Killer** 

Range: 100' + 10' / level

Illusionist 4

Duration: instantaneous

When this spell is cast, it creates a quasi-real creature that is the target's worst possible fear. It is literally the worst possible creature to fight that the target can imagine. Only the target can see the phantasmal killer; the caster sees a rough shape.

The target must make a save vs. Spells to disbelieve the phantasmal killer. If the saving throw is failed, the killer then touches the target, who must then save vs. Petrify or die from fear. Even if the target makes the second saving throw, they still take 3d6 of damage.

#### **Phantom Messenger** 

Range: special

Illusionist 3 

Duration: Special

When this spell is cast, it creates a quasi-real, birdlike creature. It may appear as a small hawk/falcon or as a large dove, and may be any shade of gray from nearly white to nearly black. It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The messenger has an Armor Class of 18 and 2 hit points, plus 1 per level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit points, the messenger disappears.

The messenger flies at a movement rate of 120 feet per round. It can bear up to one ounce per five full levels of the caster (one ounce up to level 9, two ounces up to level 14, three ounces up to level 19, and four ounces at level 20).

When created, the messenger must be given a specific destination, which can be any location on the same plane of existence to which the caster has been at least once (even if he or she was lost at the time). After the caster attaches any message or small item(s) to the legs of the bird, he or she releases it and it flies without error to the specified location.

The caster may additionally visualize a specific person whom the messenger will seek out near the target location. Note that this does not allow location of a person; the messenger will fly around the target area looking for the designated creature.

The messenger will travel at its maximum movement from the caster to the target location. Distance is no object; the messenger will continue indefinitely until the target area is reached. If a target creature was specified, the messenger will then fly around up to one day per level of the caster looking, until the target creature is found; otherwise the messenger will immediately land in the target area. After it lands the messenger will wait patiently for the message or item(s) to be removed, and then will disappear in a faint puff of smoke or mist. If the item(s) or message are not removed immediately the messenger will disappear anyway after waiting one round per level of the caster, dropping the items on the spot; this will also happen if a target creature is specified and cannot be found (the messenger will land first before this happens so as not to drop any carried objects a great distance).

#### **Phantom Steed** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 3 

Duration: 1 hour / level

The caster conjures a quasi-real horse-like creature. The steed can be ridden only by the caster or by the one person for whom he or she specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount has an AC of 18 and 12 hit points. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 40 feet per caster level. It can bear its rider's weight and what he or she carries (the steed cannot carry saddlebags or the like).

These mounts gain additional powers according to the caster's level:

8^th^ level: Ability to ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

10^th^ level: Ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.

12^th^ level: Ability to travel in the air as if it were firm land instead, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. Note, however, that the mount can not casually take off and fly.

14^th^ level: Ability to fly as if it were a pegasus.

A phantom steed's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels; for example, one created by a 13^th^ level caster can pass over water, sand, or mud as well as crossing chasms.

#### **Phantom Trap** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 2 

Duration: Permanent

The spell makes a lock or other small mechanism appear to be trapped. Anyone that can detect traps, or any spell that can detect traps will show the item to be trapped, and the person checking will be convinced that the trap is present. Nothing happens if the trap is sprung, as there is no trap. The purpose is to dissuade thieves or make the thieves waste time.

#### **Phase Door** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 6 

Duration: 1 usage / 2 levels

This spell creates a magical passage through a wall, the floor, the ceiling, or even through a section of ground. The **phase door** is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the caster, who is the only one that can use the passage. The passage is 10 feet deep plus another 5 feet for every three caster levels. The caster disappears when entering the **phase door** and appears when he or she exits. If desired, the caster can take one other creature through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor it is possible to see through it without using it.

A **phase door** is subject to **dispel magic**, but only from someone who is of higher level than the caster. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he or she is harmlessly ejected (determine randomly in which direction).

It is possible to allow other creatures to use the **phase door** by setting a triggering condition for the door. This condition can be as simple or elaborate as desired. It can be based on a creature's name or identity, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.

#### **Programmed Illusion** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 5 

Duration: Special

This spell functions like **advanced illusion**, except that this spell activates when a specific condition occurs. The caster sets the triggering condition when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as religious belief or magical ability. For example, the spell could be set to trigger when a character wearing robes and a pointed hat enters an area, but not when a Magic-User enters the area.

The spell remains ready indefinitely. When triggered, the spell will last at most 1 round per caster level.

#### **Rainbow Pattern** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 4 

Duration: concentration

This spell functions as **hypnotic pattern**, except that it affects up to 24 HD of creatures and the caster may move the pattern by up to 30 feet per round. If moved, all creatures under its effects will follow the flowing lights, trying to keep as close to it as possible. If any affected creatures move into a dangerous area, they get a new saving throw. If the view is moved out of sight of an affected creature, they are not longer affected.

This spell will continue for 2 rounds after the caster stops concentrating on it.

#### **Rope Trick** 

Range: touch

Illusionist 2 

Duration: 1 hour / level

When this spell is cast upon a piece of normal, non-magical rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extra-dimensional space, similar to a **B****ag of** **H****olding**. Creatures in the space are hidden, beyond the reach of divination spells, unless those spells work across planes.

The space holds as many as eight creatures of man-size or smaller (larger creatures cannot fit through the invisible opening at the top of the rope). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope "disappear." Otherwise, the rope simply hangs in air.

Spells cannot be cast through the extra-dimensional opening, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extra-dimensional space can see out of it as if a 3' square window were centered on the rope. The window is present, but is invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it.

The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extra-dimensional space.

When the spell ends, creatures or objects within the extra-dimensional space are ejected through the window. The rope, if still attached, drops free at the same moment.

#### **Seeming** 

Range: 30'

Illusionist 5 

Duration: 1 turn / level

This spell works as **change self**, but instead can affect up to one person per two levels of the caster. All creatures to be affected must be willing and within the given range. The caster may choose which creatures are affected and may include themselves.

#### **Shadow Door** 

Range: 10'

Illusionist 3 

Duration: 1 round / level

The caster creates the illusion of a door, which he or she will appear to pass through and close. In reality, the caster becomes **invisible** (as the spell) when the spell is cast. Any creatures opening the "door" will see an empty 10-foot square room, of similar style to the surrounding area. The caster remains **invisible** for the duration of the spell, unless, as with an **invisibility** spell, he or she attacks any creature or casts a spell.

#### **Shadow Walk** 

Range: touch (see text)

Illusionist 6 

Duration: 1 hour / level

**Shadow Walk** can only be cast in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and up to one willing creature per level are transported to the shadowy edge of reality. In this region of shadow, the caster (and all the creatures that accompany him or her) moves at an effective rate of 50 miles per hour.

Because of the blurring of reality, the caster can't make out details of the terrain or areas he or she passes over during transit, nor can he or she predict perfectly where the travel will end. When the spell effect ends, the caster and any creatures accompanying him or her arrives 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint. The caster and his or her companions always arrive at ground level, except if the landing area is in a body of water (in which case they arrive at the water level) or underground. If arriving underground, the altitude of arrival should be as close as possible to the same altitude as the intended endpoint location.

#### **Solid Fog** 

Range: 100' + 10' / level

Illusionist 4

Duration: 1 minute / level

This spell functions like **obscurement**, but in addition it is so thick that any creature trying to move through it is slowed to a speed of 5 feet, irrespective of its normal movement. It also takes a -2 penalty to all attack and damage rolls made in the fog. The solid fog also stops any physical projectiles, making ranged weapon attacks ineffective. The reduction of movement also applies to falling, so any distance that falls through the fog doesn't count toward falling damage.

This fog is more difficult to disperse than **obscurement**. It takes a severe wind (31+ mph) to disperse it, doing so in 1 round.

#### **Spectral Force** 

Range: 180'

Illusionist 3 

Duration: Special

This spell functions like **phantasmal force**, except for the following: sound, smell, and thermal effects are included; creatures created do not necessarily disappear when touched, assuming the caster causes the illusion to react appropriately. For instance the caster displays illusory wounds when the image is attacked. The spell will last for 3 rounds after concentration ceases.

#### **Stinking Cloud** 

Range: 100' +10' / level

Illusionist 3 

Duration: 10 rounds / level

The spell functions like **obscurement**, but any living creature in the cloud becomes nauseated such that they may not attack, concentrate, cast spells, or do anything other than move. A creature remains nauseated as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4 + 1 rounds after leaving the cloud. A creature may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect of the cloud, but must save every round they remain in the cloud.

#### **Suggestion** 

Range: 30'

Illusionist 4 

Duration: up to 1 hour / level

The caster influences a target creature by suggesting a course of activity limited to a sentence or two. The **suggestion** must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes the activity. The caster can specify conditions that will trigger an activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

If the recipient creature makes its saving throw, the spell has no effect. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (-1 or -2 is recommended).

The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the **suggestion**, i.e., it must be spoken in a language which the spell recipient understands. Undead are not subject to **suggestion**.

#### **Veil** 

Range: 400' radius

Illusionist 6 

Duration: 1 hour / level

This spell works as **change self**, but instead can affect any number of willing creatures within the given range. The caster may choose which creatures are affected and may include themselves.

### Illusions, Saving Throws And Disbelief

The victim of an illusion does not automatically get to save vs. Spells to resist the effects of the illusion. Rather, the victim must have a good reason to believe that a creature, object, or situation is an illusion. The Dungeon Master  must base his or her decision on the quality and the credibility of the illusion.

A high-quality illusion is one created by a caster who has a clear "mental image" of the creature, an object, or situation being simulated. For example, the quality of an illusion of a dragon cannot be high if the caster has never seen a real dragon.

An illusion can be credible only if the creature, the object, or the situation is realistic. For example, the illusion of a door on a wall is credible, but not a door floating in the air. Illusions created by higher-level spells are generally more credible since several senses are affected.

If an illusion is of low quality and/or is not credible, the DM may decide to allow an automatic save vs. Spells.

In addition, a player can announce to the Dungeon Master  that his or her character does not "believe" in the existence of a creature, an object, or a situation. The DM must then make a secret save vs. Spells for that character. Note that the DM should always make a roll, even if the creature, object, or situation is not an illusion, as omitting the roll would give this fact away to the player.

If a saving throw vs. an illusion is successful, the Dungeon Master  must announce this fact to the player; if the character then tells his or her comrades, they in turn receive a save vs. Spells with a +4 bonus.

### New Magic Items

The items listed below are magic items made by and for Illusionists. Unless otherwise noted in the item description, these items may be used by any class.

**Dust of Appearance**: This is a very find metallic looking powder. When a handful is scattered into the air, everything in a 10-foot radius is coated with the powder, negating the effects of **invisibility**, **blur**, or **displacement**. The dust's effects last for 1 turn and cannot be blown away or effectively removed. A container will typically have 1d4+4 handfuls.

**Dust of Disappearance**: This dust looks exactly like dust of appearance and is stored the same way (with the same quantities). When a handful is sprinkled on a creature or object, it becomes invisible as if from **improved invisibility**. This invisibility cannot be dispelled, but will wear off quickly in 2d6 rounds. Anyone under the effects of the dust does not know when the invisibility will end.

**Dust of Illusion**: This dust resembles powered chalk, but if stared at, it will shift in color and texture. When a handful is sprinkled on a creature or object, its form can be changed as if by a **change self** spell. (Unlike the spell, the dust affects objects in a similar manner, subject to the GM's discretion.) The effects last for 2 hours.

**Gem of Seeing**: This gem is of exceeding high quality, but otherwise appears to be a simple gem. When peered through, however, it allows the user to see as if under the effects of **true seeing**. This may be used for up to 30 minutes in any given day, but its use may be broken up into separate minute uses.

**Hat of Disguise**: This very ordinary looking hat allows the user to use the **change self** spell whenever desired. As part of the disguise, the hat may be changed to look like anything, but it must be some kind of headgear.

**Ring of Blur**: This metal ring has a smoky texture that seems to have unclear edges and a very slowly shifting pattern that can only really be seen if looked at for a while. On command, this ring gives the user the effect of the **blur** spell.

**Ring of Chameleon Power**: This thin metal ring will automatically match the skin color of the wearer's finger and become nearly invisible. The user can create a subtle illusion around him or her that will allow the user to hide. The effectiveness is influenced by the circumstances (doing this in plain sight isn't likely to succeed, doing it while no one is looking is guaranteed to work), subject to the GM's decision. The effect is an illusion, so the user is still there and can always be accidentally found. In addition, it can provide the benefit of **change self** whenever desired.

**Robe of Scintillating Colors**: The robe appears to be a non-described neutral gray color. When activated by the wearer, however, the robe displays a shifting pattering of indescribable colors, constantly shifting and cascading from the top of the robe to the bottom hem, casting off scintillating light. It takes 1 round after the wearer activates the effect for the colors to fully start flowing. This affects everyone within 30 feet of the robe. Those looking at the robe must save vs. Petrify or be dazed for 1d4+1 rounds, unable to take action until the effect ends.

In addition, the scintillating colors give the wearer concealment. The concealment starts at a -1 modifier, increasing by another -1 per round until it reaches a full -4 modifier.

While activated everything in a 30-foot radius is illuminated.

The effect can be used no more than a total of 30 rounds per day.

**Staff of Illusion**: This staff is made of dark wood, with detailed carvings of spiral and fractal patterns for its entire length. This staff allows the user to cast **detect illusion**. This requires no charges and continues to work even if the staff is exhausted of all charges. In addition is has several other abilities that do cost charges. The following powers cost one charge per use: **a****lter self**, **m****irror image**, and **p****hantasmal force**. The following powers cost two charges per use: **p****rogrammed illusion**and**rainbow pattern**. This item may only be used by Illusionists.

Making Magic Items

Illusionists follow the rules for magic-users for making magic items. Illusionists may make spell scrolls and any magic items on this page, as well as any other items the DM feels are appropriate.

## Scout

### Introduction 

This supplement provides rules for playing Scouts under the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules. If you do not already have a copy of the Basic Fantasy RPG rules, please visit the website and download a copy.

### Class Description 

The new class described in this supplement is a subclass of the Thief.  As such, they have the same attack bonus and saving throws as Thieves of the same level.  Scouts have been toughened by self-sufficiency and isolation from the supplies and comforts of civilized lands, and therefore use a d6 for hit dice. It also takes more training to be a Scout, and therefore Scouts advance at the same rate as Clerics. Scouts should be treated as Thieves for all purposes, except as described herein.

Scouts specialize in stealth operations in the wilderness. They are similar to Rangers in some ways, having similar functions and abilities.

**Requirements:** To become a Scout, a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher, a Wisdom of 11 or higher, and a Dexterity of 11 or higher. They may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however. They may only use small melee weapons, the shortbow, and the longbow. Humans, Elves, and Halflings may become Scouts. If the Half-Humans supplement is used, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may also become Scouts.

**Special Abilities:** Scouts can Move Silently, Hide, Listen, Open Locks, Detect Traps, Climb Walls, and Track using the table below.

When tracking, the Scout must roll once per hour traveled or lose the trail.

Scouts are able to detect traps, but unlike Thieves they have no special ability to remove them.

Scouts cannot pick pockets, as stealing is neither their specialty nor purpose. They usually avoid doing anything that might allow or encourage someone to track them.

Unlike a Thief, a scout gains no bonuses for back stabbing, though normal bonuses for attacking from behind or with surprise are applied.

Scouts are always expert bowmen. When using any regular bow (shortbow or longbow, but not crossbow), a Scout adds +2 to his or her Attack Bonus. At 5^th^ level, a Scout may fire three arrows every two rounds (a 3/2 rate of fire). This means one attack on every odd round, two on every even round, with the second attack coming at the end of the round. At 9^th^ level, the Scout may fire two arrows every round, with the second attack coming at the end of the round.

Scouts prefer to stay out of direct combat, and therefore practice only with small weapons as they are lighter and easier to carry. They specialize in dual wielding, however prefer to utilize their off-handed weapon as a defensive item, similar to a buckler shield. This must be declared at the start of the round, and in this case no special penalty is applied to the primary weapon, and the off-handed weapon adds an additional +1 to the wielder's AC value against a single melee attacker per round. If the weapon has a magical weapon bonus, it may be applied, but only the base bonus for those weapons with multiple values. If chosen, Scouts may attack with both weapons. In this case, they may attack with their primary weapon with a -2 penalty and their secondary with a -5 penalty to hit. Subtract from this penalty the character's Dexterity bonus, with a minimum penalty of +0 (so a character with 18 Dexterity does not get a +1 bonus to hit this way).

If a scout is operating alone or greater then 30' away from a party (or in a party composed entirely of scouts), he or she surprises foes on a 1-3 on 1d6.

::: 

**Note:** *If the DM allows Thief characters to allocate their ability percentages, as given on page 153 of the **Basic Fantasy RPG** **Core Rules**, then the Scout may also be allowed to do so. Scouts gain 30 points per level from 2^nd^ to 9^th^ levels, 20 points per level from 10^th^ to 15^th^ levels, and 10 points per level thereafter.*
