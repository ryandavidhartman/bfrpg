### Dungeon Survival

As described in the [Equipment](equipment.qmd) section, normal characters must consume one day's worth of rations (or equivalent food) and at least one quart of water per day.

Failure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1 hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.

Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single day without adequate water, the character loses 1d4 hit points, and will lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter; healing ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled.

### Time and Scale

Time is measured with a certain level of abstraction. Each **Round** of combat is comprised of a set of actions, which take place based on the initiative. For example, one attack roll may represent a whole series of feints, parries, and lunges.

Each **Action** is approximately 10 seconds long. The order a character’s action takes place in is determined by initiative.

A full combat Round (the entire initiative order) is approximately 1 minute and includes all actions (6).

A **Turn** is approximately 10 minutes (10 full combat Rounds or 60 initiative Actions).

Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so 100' becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.

### Carrying Capacity

Player characters with average strength are able to carry up to 40 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded, or up to 115 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. 
Note a character's armor weight counts against their load.

+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Strength | Light Load | Medium Load | Heavy Load |
+:=========+:==========:+:===========:+:==========:+
| 3        | 15 lbs.    | 20 lbs.     | 40  lbs.   |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 4-5      | 15 lbs.    | 30 lbs.     | 50 lbs.    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 6-8      | 25 lbs.    | 50 lbs.     | 70 lbs.    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 9-12     | 40 lbs.    | 75 lbs.     | 115 lbs.   |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 13-15    | 60 lbs.    | 115 lbs.    | 175 lbs.   |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 16-17    | 75 lbs.    | 150 lbs.    | 250 lbs.   |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 18       | 90 lbs.    | 200 lbs.    | 300 lbs.   |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+

The carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are given in the [Monsters section](monsters.qmd#beasts-of-burden).

### Movement and Encumbrance

The movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player character races can all move 50' per round. When exploring a dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.

This may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters (though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.

A character's movement rate is adjusted by his or her Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:

+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Race      | Light Load | Medium Load | Heavy Load |
+:==========+:==========:+:===========:+:==========:+
| Dwarf     | 40'        | 30'         | 20'        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Elf       | 60'        | 50'         | 40'        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Half-Elf  | 55'        | 45'         | 35'        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Halfling  | 50'        | 40'         | 30'        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| Human     | 50'        | 40'         | 30'        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+

### Mapping

In any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the Dungeon Master  describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the party can find its way back out of the dungeon.

### Light

A torch or lantern will provide light covering a **30' radius**; dim light will extend about **20' further**. Normal torches burn for 1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for 18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with dim light extending 5' further. In general, taper candles such as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.


```{ojs}

import {generalDice} from "./custom.js"

viewof torch = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Torch Turns (1d4+4)</button>`, {value: 0, reduce: () => (4 + generalDice(1,4,0))})

htl.html`
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
      ${viewof torch}
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
      Torch burn turns = ${torch}
    </div>
  </div>
`

```

<br>

```{ojs}

viewof oil = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Oil Lantern (1d6 +18)</button>`, {value: 0, reduce: () => (18 + generalDice(1,6,0) )})

htl.html`
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
      ${viewof oil}
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
      Lantern turns = ${oil}
    </div>
  </div>
`

```


### Listening

A careful character might choose to listen at a door before opening it. Anybody can hear noise on successful Perception check DC 15. Dwarves, Elves, & Half-Elves have an additional +1 to hear noise. Thieves have a special ability, [Listen](class.qmd#listen), which should be applied if the listener is a Thief. 

Sounds heard might include voices, footsteps, or any other sound the DM considers appropriate. Of course, the room beyond the door might really be silent; thus, the Dungeon Master must make the roll, so that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything away to the players.


### Open Doors

A stuck door can be typically opened on a DC roll of 13; add the character's Strength bonus to the range, so that a character with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a DC 11.
Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on a DC 15 Strength bonus.
Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a DC 20 + Strength bonus.


```{ojs}

viewof i = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Stuck Door</button>`, {value: 1, reduce: () => ((generalDice(1,20,0) >= 13 ? 'Success' : 'Failed' ) )})
viewof j = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Locked Door</button>`, {value: 0, reduce: () => ( (generalDice(1,20,0) >= 15 ? 'Success' : 'Failed' ))})
viewof k = Inputs.button(html`<button style="color: black; background-color: lightgray;">Bend Bar</button>`, {value: 0, reduce: () => ((generalDice(1,20,0) >= 20 ? 'Success' : 'Failed' ) )}) 

htl.html`
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
      ${viewof i}
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
      Open Stuck Door Results = ${i}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
      ${viewof j}
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
      Open Locked Door Results = ${j}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
      ${viewof k}
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
      Bend Bar Results = ${k}
    </div>
  </div>
`

```


### Traps

Normal characters can detect traps on a successful DC 17 + Investigation Skill bonus. Thieves have a special ability to [find and remove traps](class.qmd#findremove-traps). 

Dwarves have a +1 racial bonus to Investigation Skill checks when stonework traps are involved. A Dwarven Thief is a special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher. 

In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10' square area. A single character may only effectively search a given area for traps once, even if the character has more than one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven Thief above).

Magic-Users and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at a DC 17 chance.

### Secret Doors

Generally, searching for secret doors takes one turn per character per 10' of wall searched. A secret door is found on a successful DC15 + Perception Skill check. Elves and half-elves have a +1 racial bonus.

Multiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search, and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.

Note that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of how it works. The DM may require additional rolls or other actions to be taken before the door can be opened.

### Falling Damage

Characters suffer 1d6 damage per 10' fallen, up to a maximum 20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole number, so that a fall of 1-4' does no damage, 5'-14' does 1d6, etc.
