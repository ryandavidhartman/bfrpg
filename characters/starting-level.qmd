# Starting Level

A character’s **level** measures their experience, skill, and renown.  New adventurers begin at either **0-level** or **1st level**, depending on the campaign’s tone and the Dungeon Master’s guidance.  Each level represents growth through hard-won experience—earned not by time passed, but by treasure claimed, monsters defeated, and dangers survived.

## 0-Level Characters

Some campaigns begin with **0-level characters** ordinary peasants, laborers, or would-be heroes who have not yet proven themselves in the crucible of adventure.  These characters are fragile and untested, relying more on luck than on training or courage.

DMs seeking additional guidance should see [The Gauntlet](../gauntlet.qmd) section.

Because 0-level characters benefit from beginner’s luck, they may wield any gear until reaching 1st level.

**0-level characters creation**

- [Roll Ability Scores](abilities.qmd#stat-roller)  
- [Choose a Race](races.qmd)  
- **Hit Points:** equal to Constitution modifier (minimum 1)  
- [Roll a Backgroud](backgrounds.qmd)  
- [Choose an Alignment](alignments.qmd)  
- **Starting Gear:** see page 33  

0-level characters advance to **1st level** after surviving their first adventure (see page 39).

## 1st-Level Characters

Some campaigns begin with **1st-level characters**—fledgling heroes ready to face the perils of the dungeon.  
They are sturdier and more capable than their 0-level counterparts, each possessing the first spark of true adventuring skill.

**1st-level characters begin play with:**

- **Ability Scores:** see page 15  
- **Choice of Ancestry:** see page 16  
- **Choice of Class:** see pages 18–24  
- **One Class Talent Roll**  
- **Hit Points:** equal to one roll of the class hit-point die + Constitution modifier (minimum 1); these replace any HP gained at level 0  
- **Background:** see page 26  
- **Choice of Alignment:** see page 27  
- **Title:** see page 30  
- **Starting Gear:** see page 33
